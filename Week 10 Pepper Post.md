# Is there something inherently wrong with enhancing the human race?

Just as a thought exercise, I would like to consider the question 

" Is there something inherently wrong with enhancing the human race?"

By *inherently* I mean disregarding the troubles that could arise on the journey towards enhancement, like many discussed in this course (social and economic inequalities, dangerous medical practices, technological feasibility, etc.). If we could enhance the human race- through the emerging technologies in synthetic biology and cybernetics - should we? 

I would argue that we should enhance the human race if this goal could be pursued without auxiliary considerations. I approach this argument from a utilitarian perspective: the minimization of suffering and maximization of pleasure across all sentient beings. Almost by definition, enhancing the human race will move us towards this goal, for if it didn't then it wouldn't be considered an enhancement. 

However, now I can see some holes in this argument, and perhaps the futility in trying to divorce it from the instrumental considerations of enhancement. How do we know that an enhancement that in the short term improves this utilitarian calculus, does not do more harm in the long term? As Yuval Noah Harari argues in *Sapiens*, there is a case to be made that for all the technological progress humanity has made, there is more net suffering in the world now than there was when humans were hunter-gatherers. 


As always, I would love to hear your responses to this question (especially on that contentious last point that Harari makes)!
