# Myasthenia Gravis

- Ach is released from axon terminals at NMJ
- AChE is an enzyme that sits on the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) and deactivates ACh
- botulim toxin blocks the release of ACh

- symptoms of myasthenia gravis:
	- despondance
	- blurred vision
	- eye strain
	- achy hands and fingers
	- worsening atheltic performance
	- gasping for air
	- weakness
	- fatigue
	- doubled cission
	- stinging eyes 
	- drooping eyelids
	-	normal nerve function
	-	normal muscle function
	-	problem is in NMJ

# Mitral Valve Prolapse

- heart valves close and open due to pressure differences on the two sides of the valve
- the first heart sound occurs when the AV valves (mitral and tricuspid) close at the onset of ventricular systole
- insufficient AV valve -> does not close properly during systole -> there will be backflow into the atria (produces a gurgling systolic murmur)
- stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of each ventricle (EDV - ESV)
- cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate
- papillary muscles function to stop the AV valves from inverting
- damage to the left papillary muscles would mean that the left AV valve (mitral) could invert
- mitral valve prolapse allows blood to flow out of the left ventricle to the left atrium during systole
- mitral valve prolaps does not change stroke volume	
- this reduced **forward stroke volume and forward cardiac output (ie to the aorta)**
	- this reduces systolic blood pressure
	- HR will raise to compensate
- pulmonary blood pressure will increase due to backflow
- this will cause more fluid to leave the capillaries in the lungs and enter the air sacks -> wet breath sounds
- decreased blood pressure will cause flitration in the kidneys to decrease and potentially lead to kidney failure


- mitral valve prolapse can result from damaged papillary muscle on the left side of the heart
- this reduces forwards stroke volume because blood backs up into the atria
- cardiac output is reduced
- blood pressure in the systemic system is reduced
- heart rate increases as a compensatory measure
- pulmonary circulation will decrease due to backflow
- pulmonary pressure will increase => inrceased capillary filatration in the lungs => **rales (wet breath sounds)**
- breathing rapidly to compensate

# Fetal Heart

- fetal heart capillaries receive oxegen from the placenta
- fetal heart adaptations
1. umbilical vein
	- carries oxegenated blood from the placenta back towards the liver area
	- at the umbilical vein, it can either go through all the capillaries in the liver, or take a shortcut through the ductus venous
2. dutus venous 
	- this is shortcut to the inferior vena cava
	- this partially oxegenates the blood from the lower extremities
	- dumps blood into right atrium
	- blood in the right atrium can go to the right ventricle -> pulmonary artery -> lungs
	- the lung air sacs are full of fluid with little blood vessels going past them
	- the means there is not much oxegen
		- this causes hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
		- this leads to high resistance in the lungs and high blood pressure (P = QR)
		- this means there is a lot of pressure in the right atrium and right ventricle (right side of heart)
		- this causes blood to flow from the right atrium across the **foramen ovale** to the left atrium
3. Foramen ovale (right to left shunt)
	- not much blood comes back through the pulmonary veins, so blood flow coming from right atrium helps to replace this
	- blood is squeezed from the left ventricle into the aorta
4. Ductus arteriosus (right to left shunt)
	- allows blood to go from the pulmonary artery to the aorta
	- there are high pressures in the pulmonary artery
5. Umbilical Artery
	- a major branch off of the internal illiac arteries
	- returns blood back to the placenta
	- placenta has a very low resistance
	- this causes blood to divert towards it

- a ventricle septal defect allows blood flow from left to right ventricle
- this increases the blood flow to the right ventricle and thus to the lungs -> congestion due to high blood pressure in pulmonary arteries
- pulmonary circulation is less in the fetus due to collapsed lungs
- 130-160 HR is normal in a human fetus
- cyanosis: blue skin coloration produced by low O2 levels in the tissues
- mitral valve prolaps corresponds to a whirring sound between the lub and dub (during systole)

# Hot tub mystery

- heat => vasodilation and reduced peripheral resistance => reduced blood pressure + sweating
- alcohol =>
	-  narcotizes the brain preventing normal responses to decreased blood pressure
	- vasodilation due to increased decreased sympathetic stimulation
	- dehydration due to interference with anti-diuretic hormon (ADH) 
- Effect of lasix on body:
	- loop diuretic (water pills)
	- decreases fluids in body by increasing amount of salt and water lost in the urine
	- helps with swelling from congestive heart failure or liver disease and kidney disease
	- reduces BP
- low bp => loss of conciousness

# Into Thin Air

- altitude sickness:
	- bodies reaction to low O2 levels at high altitudes
- the pulmonary response to high altitude is hyperventillation
	- acute adpatation to high altitude and low O2 is by hyperventillation which improves O2 saturation.
	- hyperventillation: increased ventillation rate independent of cellular O2 needs, leading to abnormally low CO2 levels and high blood pH
	- contrast this with **hyperpnea** which is an increased depth and rate of ventilation to meet and increased O2 demand
- hyperventillation makes it harder to unload PO2 because there is less CO2 (bohr effect)
- 2,3 DPG is a glycolyssi intermediate in erythrocytes which accumulates when peripheral tissues are hypoxic.
	- this casues a reduced affinity of Hb for O2 => shifts dissociation curve right => enhanced unloading
- increased EPO production => higher hematocrit (number of red blood cells)
	- released from the kidney (a processs called polycythemia)
	- stimulates bone marrow to make more red blood cells
- **gammow bag** is a portable hyperbaric chamber used for treatment of acute mountain sickness. 
- how to test for HAPE:
	- neurologic test for brain swelling
	- lung function (check for fluids in lungs)
	- heart rate and blood pressure
	- blood test to measure blood gases and kidney function
- expectation with HAPE:
	- increase HR
	- increase BP
	- decreased blood O2 levels
	- increased hematorcrit
	- decreased lung fuction 
	- incomplete renal compensation
	- respiratory quotient R = CO2 production/O2 consumption
	- a low R indicates that mark's body is not metabolizing fuel properly (he is moving towards an anaeroblic metabolism)

$$ P_{AO2} = P_{iO2} - P_{ACO2}/R$$

$$P_{AO2}$$ is the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
$$P_{iO2}$$ is the inspired pressure oxygen (inspired oxygen tension)
$$P_{ACO2}$$ is the avolar partial pressure of CO2
$$R$$ is the respiratory quotient
![[Pasted image 20210419115218.png]]

HAPE:
- decreased oxygen at altitude -> decreased arterial oxygen -> uneven pulmonary vasoconstriction -> pulmonary hypertension -> overperfusion -> increased capillary pressure -> capillary stress failure -> leakage of capillaries -> HAPE

# Asthma Attack

Factors leading to asthma attack:
- swelling of airways
- increased mucus production
- bronchoconstriction
- any bronchoconstrictino ontop of their elevated basline inflamation can lead to an asthma attack
- swelling -> increased resistance -> increased pressure gradient required to maintain ventillation -> increased muscle contraction 
	- may require: scalenes, sternocleidomastoid, serratus anterior, pectoralis minor, and upper trapezius
	- this requires more energy and can make breathing tiring 
- harder to breath out -> harder to get rid of CO2 -> higher partial pressure of CO2 -> more O2 dissociating than normal

- tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory volume will all decrease during an asthma attack

- quick relief inhaler contain albuterol, a bronchodilator
	- opens up airways -> lower resistance to airflow (asthma is an obstructive pulmonary disease)
- nebulized albuterol is a fine liquid mist delivered to the lungs through an oxygen mask for an extended period of time.



# ECG Lab

- leads arranged on left and right side of chest
- using Photoplethysmography to measure volumetric blood changes
	- uses optical methods to detect pulsations in blood flow 
	- on finger
	- red LED and sensor on other side of the skin
	- measures how much light is transmitted through finger
	- allows for a calculation of heart rate and a visualization of heart rate changes across time
	- needs to be pressing into finger but not hard to permit bloodflow
	- gives a flow rate curve (similar to those seen in wiggers, but different because it is in the finger)
	- non-zero diastolic flow due to recoil of arteries
- color word test used to simulate mental exertion to measure the effect on heart rate (exertion should result in a rise of heart rate)
	- this effect was minimal in the lab
- holding breath had little effect on heart rate (without the diving reflex), amybe should decrease a bit
- breathing out with a closed mouth (valsalva):
	- should have a heart rate drop at the beginning 
	- then a gradual rise as you continue (see image below)

**valsalva:**
Based on the characteristic hemodynamic changes, Valsalva maneuver divides into four phases.

Phase I, which corresponds to the onset of strain, is associated with a transient rise in blood pressure because of emptying of some blood from the large veins and pulmonary circulation.

Phase II follows this when positive intrathoracic pressure leads to a reduced venous return to the heart. Because of reduced venous return and thus reduced preload, stroke volume falls; this leads to a fall in blood pressure activating the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. Vagal withdrawal followed by increased sympathetic discharge ensues, leading to marked tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and vasoconstriction which leads to the recovery of blood pressure to the normal values in healthy individuals.

Phase III is the transient phase involving the release of strain which leads to a sudden dip in blood pressure. The release of positive pressure leads to expansion of the pulmonary vascular bed and reduces left ventricular cross-sectional area resulting in a transient fall in blood pressure.[6]

Phase IV is the overshoot of the blood pressure above the baseline, which is because of resumption of normal venous return to the heart stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system during Phase II. The overshoot of blood pressure leads to stimulation of baroreflex leading to bradycardia and return of blood pressure to the baseline.[4][7]

- **diving reflex**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_reflex

When the face is submerged and water fills the nostrils, sensory receptors sensitive to wetness within the nasal cavity and other areas of the face supplied by the fifth (V) cranial nerve (the trigeminal nerve) relay the information to the brain.[1] The tenth (X) cranial nerve, (the vagus nerve) – part of the autonomic nervous system – then produces bradycardia and other neural pathways elicit peripheral vasoconstriction, restricting blood from limbs and all organs to preserve blood and oxygen for the heart and the brain (and lungs), concentrating flow in a heart–brain circuit and allowing the animal to conserve oxygen.[3][6]

In humans, the diving reflex is not induced when limbs are introduced to cold water. Mild bradycardia is caused by subjects holding their breath without submerging the face in water.[10][11] When breathing with the face submerged, the diving response increases proportionally to decreasing water temperature.[8] However, the greatest bradycardia effect is induced when the subject is holding their breath with their face wetted.[10] Apnea with nostril and facial cooling are triggers of this reflex.[1][8]

- profs heart rate went below 70 bpm due to diving reflex
