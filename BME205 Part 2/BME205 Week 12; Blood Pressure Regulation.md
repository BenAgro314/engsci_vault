### Intermittent Flow Through A Flexible Tube

![[Pasted image 20210329181002.png]]

- **systolic blood pressure (SBP):** maximum pressure measured in aorta 
- **diastolic blood pressure (DBP):** minimum pressure measured in aorta
- **pulse pressure (PP) =** (systolic pressure) - (diastolic pressure)
- **mean artieral pressure:** $\text{MAP} = \text{DBP} + \frac{1}{3}\text{PP}$

- mean arterial pressure drops throughout the systemic circulation
- it drops the most in the arterioles because they have the most resistance

- **flow resistance:**

$P$: pressure
$R$: flow resistance
$Q$: flow rate
$r$: arteriolar radius (or any vessel radius in general)

- ateriolar radius is a function of 
	- local metabolic controls
	- extrinsic vasocontrictor (sympathetic) control


$L$: length
$TPR$: total peripheral resistance
$CO$: cardiac output
$\Delta P$: mean arterial pressure difference 
$\eta$: dynamic viscosity
- this depends on the number of blood cells

$$R = \frac{8\eta L}{\pi r^4}$$
$$\Delta P = QR = Q \frac{8\eta L}{\pi r^4}$$ (poiseuille's law)
$$\Delta P = \text{CO} \times \text{TPR}$$
$$\text{TPR} \sim \frac{1}{r^4}$$
$$\text{TPR} \sim \eta $$

- arterioles have the **largest pressure drop**
	- changing blood pressure is achieved through changing the radius of the arterioles
	- this is why they are called the **resistance vessels**
	- aterioles are pretty much just made of smooth muscle (less elastic)
	- most sympathetic innervation is to the arterioles


- **pulmonary circulation**
	- the highly branched structure of pulmonary circulation lowers pulmonary resistance

- low oxegen levels and high CO2 levels cause vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arteries (opposite effect to the systemic circulation)
	- this is an intrinsic factor (local control)
- NO causes dilation in the pulmonary arteries

 - **reconditioning organs** (eg, kidneys, digestive tract, skin)
	 - get more blood

 ##### Blood Vessel Structure
 
 - alternating layers of connective tissue (fibrous and elastic), smooth muscle, and epithelial cells
 - outermost layer: **tunica adventitia**
	 - collagen rich connective tissue
 - middle layer: **tunica media**
	 - connective tissue and smooth muscle
 - **external elastic lamina: **
	 - a layer found in some vessels between tunica adventitia and tunica media
 - innermost layer: **tunica intima**
	 - single layer of endothelial cells
	 - surrounded by a basement membrane of connectiv tissue
	 - in some vessel, it is surrounding by a layer called teh **internal elastic lamina**

### Arteries

1. rapid transit pathways for blood from the heart to the organs
2. act as a **pressure resevoir**
	- provide driving force for blood when heart is relaxing
- all vessels are lined with smooth endothelial cells that are continuous with the endocardium of the heart
- smooth muscle surrounds this inner layer
- surrounded by connective tissue
	- collagen: tensile strength
	- elastin: elasticity
- During pump:
	- more blood enters than leaves (capillaries have more resistance)
	- temporary expansion
	- passive recoil during diastole


##### Blood pressure measurment 

- use a sphygmomanometer
	- externally applied inflatable cuff with presure gauge
	- wrapped around upper arm, pressure of cuff is applied to brachial artery
	- balance pressure until blood flow is cutt off
	- stethoscope over brachial artery at inside of elbow below cuff
	- **korotkoff sounds**

### Arterioles

##### Major resistance vessels
- offer most resistance in vascular tree (small r)
- cause large pressure drop
- convert to non-pulsile pressure

##### Vascular Tone
- state of ongoing partial constriction
	- caused by myogenic activity 
	- NE released by sympathetic fibers also contributes
	- allows for vasodilation

##### Arteriolar radius
- local metabolic changes 
- histamine release
- heat/cold
- myogenic response to stretch

###### Local influences

- **active hyperaemia:** vasodilation -> more blood to area
- causes of vasodilation 
	- less O2
	- more CO2
	- more acid
	- more osmolarity (concentration of solutes)
	- adenosin release
	- prostaglandin release

###### Local Vasoactive mediators
- endothelial lining releases chemical mediators
	- NO -> arteriolar vasodilation by inhibiting Ca2+ entry
	- endothelin -> vasoconstriction
	- chemicals that acuse **angiogenisis** (vessel growth)

###### Local Histamine release
- paracrine activity that causes vasodilation

###### Shear
- increased shear -> NO release -> vasodilation -> decreased shear

###### Myogenic response to stretch
- stretch -> myogenic tone increase -> vasoconstriction

###### Reactive hyperaemia
- occluded blood flow -> arteriole dilation
	1. myogenic relaxation (decrease stretch due to less blood)
	2. decrease O2, increase CO2, increase metabolites
- post occlusion blood flow is larger due to vasodilation

###### Autoregulation

- keep flow constant despite changes in pressure
- lower MAP -> dilation (by mechanisms listed above) -> further reduction in pressure (aggrevates problem)
- hyper tension -> increased tone and resistance -> vasoconstriction (reduces flow to normal in spite of increased pressure)

###### Extrinsic Sympathetic control of arteriolar radius

- NE binds to alpha 1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction (except for in brain) -> maintains flow to brain by reducing systemic flow
- skeletal and cardiac muscle have local controls that override the generaly sympathetic vasoconstriction 
- no parasympathetic innervation to vessels
	- except for penis and clitoris

### Veins

- capillaries -> venules -> veins -> heart
- veins are **capacitance vessels** (blood resevoir)
- thinner walls, less smooth muscle, less elastivity (collagen >> elastin), low myogenic tone
	- highly distensible with little recoil
- contains 60% of blood volume at rest

##### Venous return
- **venous return:** volume of blood entering each atrium per minut from the veins (equals cardiac output at steady state)
- lower venous return -> lower EDV -> lower CO by Frank-Starling mechanism

##### Sympathic activity

- causes venous vasocontriction
	- increased venous pressure
	- increased pressure gradient -> increased venous return (VR)
	- dereased venous capacity -> increased VR
- notice that vasoconstriction increases flow rate in veins

##### Skeletal Muscle
- acts a pump
- decreases VC -> increased VR
- conteracts gravity

##### Venous Valves

- prevents backflow when veins are squeezed
- counteract gravity
- varicose veins occure when the venous valves become incompetent (unable to close)

##### Respiratory Activity
- chest pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure
- presure gradient -> increased VR -> increased CO

##### Cardiac Suction
- increased venous return
