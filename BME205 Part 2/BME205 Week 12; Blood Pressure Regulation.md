# Blood Pressure Regulation

**microcirculation** refers to blood flow through the **arterioles** -> **capillaries** -> **venules**.

### Intermittent Flow Through A Flexible Tube

![[Pasted image 20210329181002.png]]

- **systolic blood pressure (SBP):** maximum pressure measured in aorta 
- **diastolic blood pressure (DBP):** minimum pressure measured in aorta
- **pulse pressure (PP) =** (systolic pressure) - (diastolic pressure)
- **mean artieral pressure:** $\text{MAP} = \text{DBP} + \frac{1}{3}\text{PP}$

- mean arterial pressure drops throughout the systemic circulation
- it drops the most in the arterioles because they have the most resistance
![[Pasted image 20210329181449.png]]

- **flow resistance:**

$P$: pressure
$R$: flow resistance
$Q$: flow rate
$r$: arteriolar radius (or any vessel radius in general)

- ateriolar radius is a function of 
	- local metabolic controls
	- extrinsic vasocontrictor (sympathetic) control


$L$: length
$TPR$: total peripheral resistance
$CO$: cardiac output
$\Delta P$: mean arterial pressure difference 
$\eta$: dynamic viscosity
- this depends on the number of blood cells

$$R = \frac{8\eta L}{\pi r^4}$$
$$\Delta P = QR = Q \frac{8\eta L}{\pi r^4}$$ (poiseuille's law)
$$\Delta P = \text{CO} \times \text{TPR}$$
$$\text{TPR} \sim \frac{1}{r^4}$$
$$\text{TPR} \sim \eta $$

- arterioles have the **largest pressure drop**
	- changing blood pressure is achieved through changing the radius of the arterioles
	- this is why they are called the **resistance vessels**
	- aterioles are pretty much just made of smooth muscle (less elastic)
	- most sympathetic innervation is to the arterioles


- **pulmonary circulation**
	- the highly branched structure of pulmonary circulation lowers pulmonary resistance
	
![[Pasted image 20210329183231.png]]

- low oxegen levels and high CO2 levels cause vasoconstriction in the pulmonary arteries (opposite effect to the systemic circulation)
	- this is an intrinsic factor (local control)
- NO causes dilation in the pulmonary arteries

 - **reconditioning organs** (eg, kidneys, digestive tract, skin)
	 - get more blood

 ##### Blood Vessel Structure
 
 - alternating layers of connective tissue (fibrous and elastic), smooth muscle, and epithelial cells
 - outermost layer: **tunica adventitia**
	 - collagen rich connective tissue
 - middle layer: **tunica media**
	 - connective tissue and smooth muscle
 - **external elastic lamina: **
	 - a layer found in some vessels between tunica adventitia and tunica media
 - innermost layer: **tunica intima**
	 - single layer of endothelial cells
	 - surrounded by a basement membrane of connectiv tissue
	 - in some vessel, it is surrounding by a layer called teh **internal elastic lamina**

### Arteries

1. rapid transit pathways for blood from the heart to the organs
2. act as a **pressure resevoir**
	- provide driving force for blood when heart is relaxing
- all vessels are lined with smooth endothelial cells that are continuous with the endocardium of the heart
- smooth muscle surrounds this inner layer
- surrounded by connective tissue
	- collagen: tensile strength
	- elastin: elasticity
- During pump:
	- more blood enters than leaves (capillaries have more resistance)
	- temporary expansion
	- passive recoil during diastole


##### Blood pressure measurment 

- use a sphygmomanometer
	- externally applied inflatable cuff with presure gauge
	- wrapped around upper arm, pressure of cuff is applied to brachial artery
	- balance pressure until blood flow is cutt off
	- stethoscope over brachial artery at inside of elbow below cuff
	- **korotkoff sounds**

### Arterioles

##### Major resistance vessels
- offer most resistance in vascular tree (small r)
- cause large pressure drop
- convert to non-pulsile pressure

##### Vascular Tone
- state of ongoing partial constriction
	- caused by myogenic activity 
	- NE released by sympathetic fibers also contributes
	- allows for vasodilation

##### Arteriolar radius
- local metabolic changes 
- histamine release
- heat/cold
- myogenic response to stretch

###### Local influences

- **active hyperaemia:** vasodilation -> more blood to area
	- arteriolar dilation in response to local chemical changes that accompany increased metabolic activity of the tissue
- causes of vasodilation 
	- less O2
	- more CO2
	- increased potassium
	- more acid
	- more osmolarity (concentration of solutes)
	- adenosine release
	- prostaglandin release

###### Local Vasoactive mediators
- endothelial lining releases chemical mediators
	- NO -> arteriolar vasodilation by inhibiting Ca2+ entry
	- endothelin -> vasoconstriction
	- chemicals that acuse **angiogenisis** (vessel growth)

###### Local Histamine release
- paracrine activity that causes vasodilation

###### Shear
- increased shear -> NO release -> vasodilation -> decreased shear

###### Myogenic response to stretch
- stretch -> myogenic tone increase -> vasoconstriction

###### Reactive hyperaemia
- occluded blood flow -> arteriole dilation
	1. myogenic relaxation (decrease stretch due to less blood)
	2. decrease O2, increase CO2, increase metabolites
- post occlusion blood flow is larger due to vasodilation

###### Autoregulation

- keep flow constant despite changes in pressure
- lower MAP -> dilation (by mechanisms listed above) -> further reduction in pressure (aggrevates problem)
- hyper tension -> increased tone and resistance -> vasoconstriction (reduces flow to normal in spite of increased pressure)

###### Extrinsic Sympathetic control of arteriolar radius

- NE binds to alpha 1 receptors, causing vasoconstriction (except for in brain) -> maintains flow to brain by reducing systemic flow
- skeletal and cardiac muscle have local controls that override the generaly sympathetic vasoconstriction 
- no parasympathetic innervation to vessels
	- except for penis and clitoris

### Veins

- capillaries -> venules -> veins -> heart
- veins are **capacitance vessels** (blood resevoir)
- thinner walls, less smooth muscle, less elastivity (collagen >> elastin), low myogenic tone
	- highly distensible with little recoil
- contains 60% of blood volume at rest

##### Venous return
- **venous return:** volume of blood entering each atrium per minut from the veins (equals cardiac output at steady state)
- lower venous return -> lower EDV -> lower CO by Frank-Starling mechanism

##### Sympathic activity

- causes venous vasocontriction
	- increased venous pressure
	- increased pressure gradient -> increased venous return (VR)
	- dereased venous capacity -> increased VR
- notice that vasoconstriction increases flow rate in veins

##### Skeletal Muscle
- acts a pump
- decreases VC -> increased VR
- conteracts gravity

##### Venous Valves

- prevents backflow when veins are squeezed
- counteract gravity
- varicose veins occure when the venous valves become incompetent (unable to close)

##### Respiratory Activity
- chest pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure
- presure gradient -> increased VR -> increased CO

##### Cardiac Suction
- increased venous return

### The Baroreceptor Reflex

- change in cardiac output and total peripheral resistance due to blood pressure stimuli
- **recetors:**
	- **carotid sinus**
	- **aortic arch**
	- mechanoreceptors sensitive to changes in mean arterial pressure and pulse pressure
	- these are tonic (continually generate APs in response to blood pressure)
	- higher blood pressure => increased rate of AP firing (and visa versa)


![[Pasted image 20210414075201.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210414075308.png]]

- integrated by **cardiovascular control center** in the medulla of the brain stem
	- alters ratio between sympathetic and parasympathetic activity to effector organs
- see figure below for the response to changes in BP:
	- increased parasympathetic stimulation => decreased HR => decreased CO => decreased BP
	- increased sympathetic stimulation=>
		- increased HR and contractile strength => increased CO => increased BP
		- vasocontriction of arterioles => increased total peripheral resistance => increased BP
		- vasocontriction of veins => increased venous return => increased stroke volume => increased CO => increased BP

![[Pasted image 20210414075350.png]]

### Other Reflexes and Responses

- left arterial volume receptors and hypothalamic osmoreceptors are important to maintain the salt balance in the blody. they affect BP by controlling plasma volume
- chemoreceptors in carotid and aortic arteries are sensitive to low oxygen (< 60 mmHg) or high acid levels. This increases respiratory activity and increased BP by sending excitatory signals to the cardiovascular center
- behviours and emotions affect cardiac output through the cerebral cortex hypothalamic pathway (sympathetic fight or flight, sexual arousal, blushing)
- cardiovascular changes due to exercise. yet unindentified exercise centers in the brain (see summary table below)
- hypothalamic control over cutaneous (skin) arterioles for the purpose of temperature control. This takes precidence over the same control of these vessels for the purposes of BP
- vasoactive substances released from enothelial cells play a role in mediating blood pressure (eg. nitric oxide, NO, causes vasodilation)

![[Pasted image 20210414080145.png]]

### Orthostatic Hypotension

- transient hypotensive (low BP) condition where there is insufficient compensatory responses to gravitational shifts of blood when a person moves from the horizontal to vertical position
- standing up after lying for a long time causes blood to pool in the legs, reducing venous return
	- decreases stroke volume and thus CO
	- this is detected by baroreceptors which initiate compensatory responses
- these reflexes may be reduced after a long bed rest => dizzyness or fainting
- see summary picture below

![[Pasted image 20210414081107.png]]


### Circulatory Shock

- when BP is slow low flow to the tissues can no longer be maintained
1.  **Hypovolemic (low volume) shock**: caues by a fall in blood volume (hemmorage, diarrhoea, urinary losses, sweating)
2.  **Cardiogenic (heart-produced)**: weakened heart
3.  **Vasogenic (vessel produced)**: widespread vasodilation triggered by some vasodilator substance. **Septic shock** results from massive infections that release these substances. **Anaphylactic shock** results from extensive histamine release due to a severe allergic reaction
4. **neurogenic shock** involves generalized vasodilation as a result of a loss of sympathetic vascular tone. This can be caused by deep pain.

#### Consequences and Compensations

- reduction in blood volume causes a decreased venous return and a fall in cardiac output and blood pressure (after a haemmorage)
- compensatory measures try and ensure blood flow to the brain
- baroreceptor reflex causes increased sympathetic stimulation and decreased parasympathetic stimulation => increased HR to offest decreased stroke volume due to lower blood volume. This causes a weak but rapid pulse
- generalized vasoconstriction due to increased sympathetic activity => inreased venous return by means of frank-starling
- increased heart contractility => increased SV
- increased CO results
- increased peripheral resistance + increased CO => compensatory increase in BP
- fluid shift from interstitial fluid to increase blood volume **(autotransfusion)**
- plamsa protein synthesis follows which helps maintain blood volume with osmotic gradient
- urinary output is reduced
	- caused by renal vasocontriction
	- retains blood volume and thus enhances CO
- increased thirst
- incrased production of red blood cells (over the course of a week)


![[Pasted image 20210414081249.png]]


#### Irreverible Shock

- metabolic acidosis due to lactice acid production of O2 deprived tissues
- this deranges enymes involved in energy production and limits ATP production
- electrolyte imbalances from prolong kidney disfunction will lead to cardiac arryhtmias
- blood deprived pancrease will release myocardial toxic factor which weakens the heart
- vasodilator substances build up in organs 
- increasing hypotension in a positive feedback loop => death
