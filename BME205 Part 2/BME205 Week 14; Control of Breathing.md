## Gas Exchange

- oxegen diffuses from alveoli to blood 
- CO2 diffuses from blood to alveoli
- factors determining diffusion:
	- $\Delta P$: partial pressure gradient (not hydraulic pressure)
	- $R$: resistance (physical properties of gas and structures it is diffusing through)

### Diffusion at the alveolar-capillary membrane

Equations governing rate of Oxegen and CO2 diffusion our of the alveloi in the blood (across the membrane):

$$\dot{V}_{O_2} = (P_{A_{O2}} - P_{V_{O2}}) A/T$$

$$\dot{V}_{CO_2} = (P_{A_{CO2}} - P_{V_{CO2}}) A/T$$

where $\dot{V}_a$ is the rate of transfer of $a$ across the membrane. $P_{A_a}$ is the partial pressure of $a$ in the alveloi and $P_{V_a}$ is the partial pressure of $a$ in the vessels. Therefore resistance depends on 

- surface area $A$
- membrane thickness $T$
- diffusibility $D$ (reflecting solubility and molecular weight). This is ignored because it is a constant

### Partial Pressure Gradients

- diffusion occurs down a partial pressure gradient

#### Partial Pressures

- table with partial pressures for various gases:
- ![[Pasted image 20210409102113.png]]
- dry air is 79% nitrogen and 21% oxegen. Using the total atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg you can find the partial pressures (
	- the partial pressure of all the constituant gases must add to the total pressure.
	- every gas molecule, regardless of it's size, exerts the same pressure
	- partial pressure is proportional to the percentage of gas in the mixture 
- $P_{CO2}$ in the atmosphere is $0.23 mmHg \approx 0$. 
- gases dissolved in a liquid also exert a partial pressure
- the greater the partial pressure, the more gas dissolved (this also depends on solutbility)
- CO2 is 20x as soluble as O2 in water

#### Partial Pressure Gradients

![[Pasted image 20210412202549.png]]

##### Alveolar Partial Pressures of O2 and CO2

- inspired air has a different composition
	- saturated with water vapor during inhilation -> partial pressure of H2O is 47 mmHg
	- partial pressures of O2 and N2 drop accordingly to 563 mmHG and 150 mmHg respectively
- alveolar partial pressure of oxegen is also lower than atmospheric because of mixture with unexpelled air from lungs (from dead space)
	- this causes a further drop in the partial pressure of oxegen to 100 mmHg
	- this can be calculated with
	-	$$P_{A_{O2}}  = P_{I_{O2}} - P_{A_{CO2}}/R$$
	-	$R = \dot{V}_{CO_2}/\dot{V}_{O_2}$ is the **respiratory quotient**, the ratio of metabolic CO2 production to oxygen consumption
	-	$R=0.8$ for a typical healthy person
	-	$P_{A_{CO2}} = 50 mmHG$ and $P_{I_{O2}} = 150 mmHg$ normally.
-	unexpectedly, the partial pressure of oxegen does not change signifigantly during inspiration/expiration
	-	only a small proportion of alveolar air exchanged each breath 
		-	mixing new air with larger volume means that partial pressure of oxegen rises only sightly
	-	there is a constant drive for oxegen to move down its concentration gradient -> partial pressure remains constant at about 100 mmHg throughout respiration
- the partial pressure of CO2 also remains relatively constant
	- constantly produced by tissues and transported to lungs via blood

##### Partial Pressure Gradients of Oxegen and Carbon Dioxide across Pulmonary Capillaries

- blood in pulmonary arteries: low partial pressure of O2 of 40 mmHg and high partial pressure of CO2 of 46 mmHg
- diffusion occurs with lungs until no gradient exists -> 100 mmHg for O2 in pulmonary veins after visiting the lungs (once returnign to heart) and 40 mmHg of CO2
- partial pressures can be expressed as mixed contents:
	- 40 mmHg of O2 -> 150 mL of O2/L of blood, while arteriolar blood has 200 ml of O2/L => only 25% of the oxegen is used at rest
	- the rest is an immediately available reserve
- CO2 that remains in the blood is important for regulating pH and stimulating respiration
- if tissues demand more O2 (say leaving the concentration gradient at 30 mmHg), there will be a large concentration gradient at the lungs => ensures more rapid diffusion back to 100 mmHg partial pressure of alveoli
- see figure below for summary of partial pressures:

![[Pasted image 20210409104621.png]]

- other factors can influence the high end (alveoli for O2 and blood for CO2) for the gradient of diffusion
	- ventillation of lungs $\dot{V}$
	- perfusion to lung regions $\dot{Q}$
	- with high $\dot{V}/Q$ => alvolar partial pressure for oxegen will by higher (the reverse is also true), increasing the gradient for diffusion
- CO2 does not needs as large of a concentration gradient as oxegen because it is 20 times more soluble 
- see figure below for factors that influence rate of gas transfer across alveolar-capillary membrane:

![[Pasted image 20210409105046.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210412203300.png]]

### Other Factors

- **ficks law** states that the rate of diffusion of a gas also depends on the surface area and thickness of the diffusive membrane. 

#### Effect of Surface Area and Membrane Thickness on Gas Exchange

- at rest some pulmonary capillaries are closed (at the top of the lung) because blood pressure is not high enough
- during exercise, these will open with the higher blood pressure and this increases the **surface area**, $A$, available for gas exchange. This also effecitvely reduces the diffusion distance $T$.
- alveolar membranes are also stretched during exercise => greater surface area
- **capillary transit time:** the amount of time blood stays in the capillaries.
	- at rest this is 0.75 s for pulmonary capillaries which is triple the time needed for equillibriating gas exchange
	- during maximal exercise this is reduce to 0.4 s which is still enough time due to increased $A$ and reduced $T$.
- exercise at altitude is difficult because of the reduced partial pressure of oxegen in the atmosphere => equillbirum may not be met during exercise
- see figure below for summary of the effects of lower atmospheric oxegen partial pressure and impaired diffusion on the rate and position of equillbrium
- ![[Pasted image 20210409105935.png]] 
- **Pathological conditions:**
	- **emphysema** reduces surface area when alveolar walls and capillaries are lost (larger but fewer chambers)
		- this can also result in regional lung collapse, **atelectasis**
		- this affects the diffusion of O2 more than CO2 due to solubility
	- thickened  membrane increases T and reduces diffusion rate:
		- **pulmonary odedema:** excess interstital fluid between capillaries and alveoli due to pulmonary inflamation or left sided congestive heart failure
		- **pulmonary fibrosis:** replacement of lung tissue with fibrous tissue in response to irritants
		- **pneumonia:** inflammation induced accumulation of fluid around alveoli. Usually bacterial or viral infection, asipiration of food, or chemical agents

#### Effect of Diffusion Coefficient on Gas Exchange

- rate of gas transfer is proportional to diffusion coefficient, $D$, relating the solutbilty of the gas in lung tissues and inversely proportional the the molecular weight
- This is 20 x higher for CO2 than O2

#### Alveolar Dead Space

- not all alveoli are ventillated and perfused equally
- **shunts** are alveoli that are perfused but not ventillated
- **alveolar dead space** consists of alveoli that are ventillated but not perfused
	-	this is small in regular people
- the combination of **anatomic** and **alveolar dead space** is called **physiologic dead space**

##### Regional Control of Ventillation and Diffusion

- resistance of individual airways can be adjusted in response to local changes in the partial pressure of CO2
- the resistance of individual blood vessels can be controlled in response to local changes in the partial pressure of oxegen

#### Effect of Oxegen

- oxygen delivered to a lung region is analagous to water flowing into a sink
- increase ventillation => more oxygen partial pressure (and the reverse is true). Analgous to filling the sink
- the rate that oxygen is removed from the lungs depends on the perfusion. analagous to the sink drain
- if ventillation to the lung region is low, the partial pressure of O2 falls, and this hypoxia causes constriction of the vascular smooth muscle supply the lung region (analagous to partially closing the sink drain
- this causes a regional rise in the partial pressure of oxygen
- the diverts blood to non-hypoxic regions 
- evidence that the reverse occurs is weaker
	- only way to increase the alveolar partial pressure of oxegen is to increase ventillation dispropotionately to metabolic demands, therby decrease the partial pressure of CO2 in the alveoli and ateries.
	-  this will increase the arterial pressure of oxygen.
	- this effect is modest however
- high regional levels of O2 in the alveoli should be though of as causing less valsconstriction, rather than causing vasodilation

#### Effect of CO2

- rate of CO2 removal depends on ventillation
- if perfusion in the lung region is low, the regional partial pressure of CO2 falls.
- This low partial pressure of CO2, **hypocapnia**, constricts smooth muscles in the airways supplying that lung region => dereases ventillation rate
- reduced ventillation of underperfused regions is diverted to better refused ones
- see figure below for a summary of the effects of O2 and CO2 on lung and blood vessel constriction

![[Pasted image 20210409120659.png]]

#### Gas Exchange Across the Systemic Capillaries

- O2 and CO2 move between systemic capillary blood and the tissue cells by simple diffusion
- no gas exchange occurs prior to these capillaries => the partial pressures are the same as in the pulmonary veins

#### $P_{O_2}$ and $P_{CO_2}$ Gradients Across Systemic Capillaries

- cellular partial pressures average 40 and 46 mmHg for O2 and CO2 respectively
- the partial pressures the systemic capillaries never quite euilibriate with the tissues because cells are constantly producing CO2 and consuming O2 => tissue partial pressure for oxegen is always slightly lower than that in the blood, tissue partial pressure for CO2 is always slightly higher than that in the blood
- as metabolism increases, so does the partial pressure gradients => increases amount of CO2 and O2 exchanged across membrane


#### Net diffusion of Oxegen and Carbon Dioxide Between the Alveoli and Tissues

-	O2: (ventillation) alveoli -> blood -> tissues (metabolism)
- CO2: (metabolism) tissues -> blood -> alveoli (ventillation) 	


##### Bronchodilation and constriction

- bronchioles dilate due to binding of ACh with the Beta 2 receptors in the smooth muscle surrounding the tubes

![[Pasted image 20210412205801.png]]

##### Ventillation Perfusion matching

- flow of CO2 (or O2) must match in ventillation and perfusion

## Gas Transport

### Blood, Oxegen and Haemoglobin

- O2 is both dissolved in the blood and attached to Hb

![[Pasted image 20210411163549.png]]

#### Physically Dissolved Oxegen

- very little is physically dissolved due to low solubility
- ~3ml per L of blood at 100 mmHg partial pressure
- transports 1.5 percent of the oxygen

#### Oxegen Bound to Hb

- transports 98.5 percent of the oxygen
- iron bearing protein molecule that forms a reversible combination with oxegen (see equation below)

$$Hb + O_2 \leftrightarrow HbO_2$$

- $Hb + O_2$ is called reduced Hb
- $HbO_2$ is oxyhaemolglobin


![[Pasted image 20210412203523.png]]

- around 270 million Hb per RBC
- O2 molecules attach to 4 heme sites in a hemoglobin molecule (hemecytes). 
- percent haemoglobin saturation is the amount of bound oxegen divided by the maximum capacity of hemoglobin to bind to oxygen

![[Pasted image 20210412203707.png]]

#### Partial pressure of oxegen and Hb saturation



- sigmoid shaped curve: PO2 on x axis, percent Hb saturation on y axis
- O2 saturation is different than O2 concentration (see figure below)
	- anaemia is an example of this. This is where less red blood cells are produced, so even if they are all saturated, the blood is carrying less total oxygen
	
- the sequential reactions of O2 with Hb cause the sigmoid shape
- Hb is fully saturated when all Hb present is carrying maximal O2 load
- most important factor determining Hb saturation is partial pressure of oxygen

![[Pasted image 20210412204704.png]]

#### Oxegen-Hb dissociation curve

![[Pasted image 20210412204251.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210412204453.png]]

- from 0 to 60 PO2, small change in PO2 causes big change in Hb saturation
- from 60 to 100 PO2, lower slope

##### Plateau Portion

- if alveolar PO2 and thus arterial PO2 fall below the normal value of 100 mmHg, Hb saturation does not decrease greatly until PO2 falls below 60 mmHg (because of plateau)
- provides margin of safety
- if pure oxegen is inhaled, not much increaes (only 10 percent increase from 60 to 600 mmHg 



 ##### Steep portion

- 0 to 60 mmHg PO2 occurs in systemic capillaries, where O2 is unloaded
- during strenuous exercise, when PO2 is forced to drop below 40 mmHg, lots of O2 will dissociate due to the steep curve in the region P < 40 mmHg (note 40 mmHg is the PO2 at rest in metabolic cells)
- as much as 85 percent of O2 may be released during strenuous exercise
- at high altitudes
	- lower inspired PO2
	- if high enough, this results in arterial hypoxaemia (low oxygen content in blood) 
	- this will activate carotid chemoreceptors that increase ventillation
	- this will increase expired CO2 causing a fall in arterial PCO2 and an increase in alveolar and thus arterial PO2
	- this increase may only be a few mmHg but because we are on the steep portion of the dissociation curve => large increase in arterial O2 content
- it is important to note that the oxygen curve as depicted applies to conditions in the lungs where PO2 determines the saturation of arterial blood.
- in tissues, the oxegen content determines the local PO2 (opposite relationship)
- See the graph below:

![[Pasted image 20210413110014.png]]

- as oxygen is consumed and saturation drops, PO2 does not drop as much (reduced slope) => maintains partial pressure gradient for diffusion 

 ### Hb and oxegen transfer 
 

#### Hb at alveolar level

- O2 bound to Hb does not contribute to PO2
- when O2 diffuses from alveoli to blood, it is initially in solution, raising PO2. This means more will bind to Hb, lowering PO2 and allowing more to diffuse from the alveoli
- at normal 100 mmHg PO2, Hb is 97.5 percent saturated
- Basically, Hb preserves the partial pressure gradient so O2 can continually diffuse from the alveoli into the arterioles
- once Hb is saturated, PO2 is rapidly equillibriated because no more can go to Hb, and no further O2 transfer occurs


![[Pasted image 20210413113404.png]]


#### Hb at tissue level

- reverse situation to that desribed above occurs at the tissue level
- O2 diffuses from blood into tissues, lowering PO2 in blood, causing O2 to dissociate from Hb, raising blood PO2, allowing for continued diffusion
- once again Hb maintains gradient (at the high end), until it is no longer saturated, then the concentrations (and parital pressures) between the blood and tissues are equillibriated
- an oximeter cannot detect anaemia because partial pressure of blood reveils nothing about how much blood is carried by Hb
- likewise, Hb saturation cannot reveal how much O2 is carried by the blood because we don't know how many Hb binding sites there are 


 ### Unloading Oxegen
 
 -  other factors can shift the dissociation curve 
 -  exercise:
	 -  heat
	 -  CO2 
	 -  lactic acid
	 -  all three of these enhance the release of O2 from Hb => at a given PO2, Hb holds less O2
 -  pH:
	 -  CO2 is transported in the blood as bicarbonate ions. during this production H+ ions are released as a biproduct, making the blood acidic
	 -  lactic acid is also produced by muscle => increased H+
	 -  as H+ inreases, pH decreases, which **enhances the dissocation of O2 from Hb**. This is known as a the **Bohr effect**

![[Pasted image 20210413114336.png]] 

#### Bohr effect

- H+ ions combine reversibly with binding sites on Hb (other than those for O2)
- conformational change reduces Hb affinity for O2
- this is important so metabolically active cells get enough O2
- reduced Hb has a higher affinity for H+ than HbO2
	- as oxygen unloads, H+ generated by carbonic acid dissociation (CO2 production) 
	- this acts a buffer, preventing venous blood from being more acidic than arterial blood
- Bohr effect **acts in reverse in alveoli**. 
	- carbonic anhydrase-carbonic acid reaction reverses in pulmonary capillaries
	- decreased carbonic acid => decreases H+ and bicarbonate => increasing pH and decreasing dissocation of O2, facilitating its loading onto Hb  



#### Haladane effect

- increased PCO2 shifts curve right (down) and visa versa




 #### Effect of temperature on Hb saturation 
 
 - increased temp shifts curve down (increases dissociation)
 
 
  
  

#### 2,3 Bisphosphogylcerate 

- factor inside red blood cells
- increased BPG shifts curve down, increasing dissociation of O2
- BPG production increases when Hb is chronically undersaturated (hypoxemia)
	- high altitudes
- shifts curve everywhere (including lungs), unlike other factors which usually act only in the systemic system 

 


### Hb and CO

- competes for binding sites on Hb, with a far higher affinity than O2
- **carboxyhemoglobin** HbCO
- O2 content in blood is drastically reduced
- also shifts dissociation curve upwards (much greater PO2 gradient is required to unload O2)



 ### CO2
 
- transported in 3 ways
1. physically dissolved: depends on PCO2. Only about 5-10 percent is carried this way at normal PCO2 of 46 mmHg in systemic system 
2. Bound to Hb as **carbamino haemoglobin HbCO2**. binds with globin part of Hb, unlike O2. reduced Hb has a greater affinity for CO2 than oxyHb
3. As bicarbonate: accounts for 80-90 percent of transport. Faciliated by chemical reaction shown below:

![[Pasted image 20210413120331.png]]

- the middle chemical is called **carbonic acid**
- this is facilitaed by an enzyme on red blood cells called **carbonic anhydrase** 


- most CO2 is carried as bicarbonate in the blood (an acid)
- some is physically dissolved
- some is bound to hemoglobin (see figure below)
- see the bicarbonate reaction below

![[Pasted image 20210412204001.png]]




#### Chloride Shift

- bicarbonate ions accumulate in red blood cells, which passivly diffuse through a bicarbonate-choride carrier in the cell membrane 
	- this facilitates diffusion of these ions in opposite directions across teh membrane (Cl- in and HCO3- out)
- the membrane is relatively impermeable to H+ => HCO3- diffuses outwards => electrical gradient is created
- Cl- ions diffuse down this gradient into red blood cells
- this is called a **chloride (hamburger) shift**


#### Reverse Haldane Effect

- increases in PO2 from supplementary oxygen reduced the ability of Hb to bind CO2 and H+ => CO2 needs to by carried in dissolved form
- increased PCO2 is sensed by central chemoreceptors, resulting increased ventillation => **hypocamnia**



### Abnormal Blood Gas Levels

- see table below for a list of common terms used to describe various states associated with respiratory abnormalities 

![[Pasted image 20210413121148.png]]


#### Abnormalities in arterial PO2

- **hypoxic hypoxia**: low arterial PO2 and associated Hb saturation. 
	- inadaqute gas exchange
	- high altitude
- **anaemic hypoxia:** reduced O2 carry capacity of the blood.
	- decreased number of red blood cells
	- less Hb in the cells
	- CO poisoning
- **Circulatory (stagnant) hypoxia**: too little oxygenated blood is delvered to tissues.
	- blockage, vascular spasm, injury
	- circulatory shock or congestive heart failure
- **histotoxic hypoxia**: cells cannot use oxygen available to them
	- cynanide poisoning
- **hyperoxia**: above normal PO2. This can cause oxygen poisoning due to the production of free radicals that damage membranes
	- brain damage 
	- blindness (damage to retinas)





#### Abnormalities in arterial PCO2

- **hypercapnia**: excess CO2 in arterial blood 
	- caused by **hypoventillation**
	- occurs less readily than hypoxic hypoxia because CO2 is 20 times more diffusible than O2
- **hypocapnia**: low CO2 levels
	- caused by **hyperventillation**
	- not the same as increased ventillation that occurs with exercise (or any time it matched increased metabolism), which is called **hypernea**


#### Conseqnences

- changes in CO2 affect acid-base balance
- hypercapnia elevates carbonic acid production and thus H+ concentration => **respiratory acidosis**
- less than normal H+ => **respiratory alkalosis**


## Control of Breathing


### Respiratory Centers in brain

- respiratory muscles are skeletal and thus contract only when stimulated (no pacemaker activity)
- cyclic neuronal discharges from the brain control breathing
- repiratory centers in the medulla of the brain stem

#### Components of Neural control of respiration

1. generating of inspiratory/expiratory rhythm
2. regulating ventillation rate to match metabolism
3. modification of respiratory activity to serve other purposes (speech, cough, sneeze)

- come from **medulla respiratory center**

#### Inspiratory and expiratory neurons in the medullary center

- phrenic nerve and inercostal nerves supply diaphragm and external intercostal muscles which are used for inspiration (relaxed for expiration)
- cell bodies of these neurons are located in the spinal cord
- these neurons recieve signals from pre-inspiratory neurons of the medulla respiratory center
- **meduallary respiratory center:**
	-	two clusters:
		-	**dorsal respiratory group (DRG)**
			- primarily inspiratory neurons
			- firing causes inspiration (by stimulating efferent neuronal cell bodies in the spinal cord)
			- many DRG neurons project into the VRG
				- if these projections are their only ones, the neurons are called **respiratory interneurons**
		- **vental respiratory group (VRG)** 
			- composed of inspiratory neurons and expiratory neurons
			- expiratory neurons
				- premotor expiratory neurons:
					- project to motor neurons in the spinal cord that innervate the expiratory pump muscles (abnominal and internal intercostal muscles)
				- expiratory motor neurons
					- innervate muscles that narrow (adduct) the upper airways

#### Generation of respiratory rhythm

- respiratory rhythm arises from:
	- pre-botzinger complex (maybe has pacemaker component to it)
	- botzinger complex
	- VRG
	- pons


### Influences from higher centers

- higher centers can influence breathing ryhthm

#### Discharge patterns of respiratory neurons and motor neurons 

- respiratory neurons are characterized by their timing and discharge patterns:
- timing:
	- during a particular phase
	- between phases	
- discharge patterns:
	- augmenting (increasing)
	- decrementing
	- plateau
	
- inspiratory muscles exhibit increasing frequency of stimulation and motor unit recruitment during inspiration due to elastic recoil. They stop discharging at the end of inspiration
- expiratory neurons may generate signals even during restful breathing, regardless of whether or not the muscles end up contracting or not. They may stop firing before the end of expiration due to a post-expiratory pause
- motor neurons innervating the upper airway muscle cause them to widen prior to the start of inspiration, maintaining this until the end of inspiration
- motor neurons that activate muscles in the upper airway during expiration increase flow resistance to maintain lung volume and gas exchange
	- as ventillatory demands increase, these muscles relax and open the airways further
 
 

### Control of respiratory pattern


#### Mechanoreceptors

- any receptor detecting a change in pressure, flow, or displacment  of a structure is called a **mechanoreceptor**
- found in the lung and chest wall

#### Pulmonary Receptors

- lungs have lots of well studied mechanoreceptors
- signals carried by vagus nerves to brain stem
- **slowly adapting receptors (with myelinated fibers)** 
	-	endings are located in smooth muscle of airways
	-	respond to changes in lung volume (transmural pressure)
	-	inflation of the lung activates them if previously inactive or increases their discharge if already active
	- maintain discharge frequency if lung inflation is sustained
	- responsible for Breuer-Hering reflex
- **Rapidly adapting receptors (with myelinated fibers)**
	-	ending in airway epithelia
	-	exhibit rapid burst of AP in response to chemical or mechanical stimuli
	-	can lead to cough
	-	activation can cause mucus production
	-	also called iritant receptors
	-	initate sighs
- **C-figers aka J receptors (unmyelinated afferents)**: ending of these receptors are close (or juxaposed; J) to the pulmonary capillaries
	- detect increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and fluid in interstitial space
	- respond to chemical stimuli
	- when activated, cause bronchodilation and rapid, shallow breathing
	- inhibits spinal motor neurons (reduce motor activity associated with exercise and thus reduce the need to increase cardiac output to the pulmonary circulation)

#### Breuer-Hering Reflex

-  discharge from the brain stem activates inspiratory motor neurons, causing lung inflation
-  inflation activates pulmonary slowly adapting receptors => inhibits inspiratory premotor neurons (stopping inspiration)
	-  large tidal volumes are assoicated with short inspiratory durations and visa versa
-  little evidence this reflex operates in concious animals, especially in concious humans

#### Chest Wall Receptors

- **Diaphragm**
	- contains relatively few receptors (spindles and golgi tendon organs) with myelinated afferents
	- has many receptors that respond to local metabolic conditions (metaboreceptors). Their action may elicit a reflex inhibition of the diaphragm via spinal or supraspinal interneurons => reduced production of metabolites
		- activation may also contribute to the sensation of dyspnea
- **rib cage**
	- richely supplied with muscle spindles and golgi tendon organs
	- may result in dyspnea (breathlessness) when there is a difference between expected and achived outcome

#### Chemical Control

![[Pasted image 20210413193305.png]]

#### Ventillation Adjustment

- arterial blood gases are regulated by varying rate and depth of breathing to match bodies metabolism
- three chemical factors influence this
	- PCO2
	- PO2
	- H+ concentration

#### Decreased Arterial PO2

- montitored by **peripheral chemoreceptors** and the **carotid and aortic bodies** (the latter two reside at the forks of the left and right common carotic arteries and in the arch of the aorta, respectively.


#### Effect of Large decrese in PO2 on peripheral chemoreceptors

- carotid chemoreceptors are more important than the aortic chemoreceptors with respect to repiratory control
- carotid: responds to changes in arterial PO2. 
	- relatively insensitive to modest decreases in arterial PO2 until PO2 falls below 60 mmHg, the level that desaturation starts which could impair O2 transport to tissues
	- increase ventillation if PO2 in arteries falls below 60 mmHg
	- activation above this is not nessecary due to plateau of dissociation curve (already lots of saturation)
- aortic: responds to changes in arterial oxygen content
	-	causes increase in cardiac output if arterial O2 content falls
	-	an individual with anemia would have a normal PO2 but a low oxygen content 
		- increasing breathing rate would not help them (a slight increase in PO2 in arteries but would not increase O2 content)
		- they would benifit from increased cardiac output
		

#### Direct affect of large PO2 drop on the respiratory centers

- without the receptors, a drop in O2 would cause a reduction in activity and a further drop in O2 => death (positive feedback loop)
	- because cells in the brain reduce their activity in response to hypoxia
- newborns are extremly resistant to hypoxia

#### Carbon dioxide generated H+

- arterial PO2 does not contribute to minute-to-minute ventillation
- PCO2 is the most important factor regulating ventillation under resting conditions

#### Effect of increased PCO2 on the central chemoreceptors

- during hypercabia (high CO2 levels), the carotid chemoreceptors are sensitized to PO2
- most importantly detected by the **central chemoreceptors** locted in the medulla and near respiratory centers
	- present in many areas of the brain stem
	- do not monitor carbon dioxide but are sensitive to changes in H+ ion concentrations in the brain extracellular fluid that baths them
- the BBB is permiable to CO2 => changes in PCO2 in the blood result in changes in the brain extracellular fluid
- increased PCO2 in brain extracellular fluid raises concentration of H+ ions according to law of mass action => stimulates central chemoreceptors which increase rate of ventillation
- H+ cannot permiate blood brain barrier
- H+ in plasma cannot gain access to central chemoreceptors


![[Pasted image 20210413200107.png]]

#### Direct Effect of Large PCO2 increase on respiratory centers

- very high levels directly repress the whole brain, including respiratory centers
- up to PCO2 to 70-80 mmHg we see increased ventillation, higher PCO2 levels result in reduced ventillation

#### Loss of sensitivity to PCO2 with lung disease

- some patients with severe chronic lung disease lose their sensitivity to elevated arterial PCO2
- chronic retention of carbon dioxide results in an increased generation of hydrogen ions in the brain extracellular fluid which eventually neutralizes the influx of bicarbonate across the BBB
- additional bicarbonate combines with excess H+ raising the pH
	- thus H+ ions concentration returns to normal although PCO2 reamins high in the blood and brain remains high

### Acid Base Balance

- carotid chemoreceptors respond to changes in H+ 
- increased CO2 => increased H+ => decreased pH=> peripheral chemoreceptors cause increased ventillation
- can respond to H+ variations that are not caused by changes in CO2 (unlike the brain because H+ cannot cross the BBB)
- ventillation helps regulate the acid base balance of the blood
	- changes in CO2 induced H+ can compensate for other pH variations

### Effect of exercise on ventillation

![[Pasted image 20210413201059.png]]

- there is much investigation as to how/why ventillation increases during exercise
	- the three variables (PO2, PCO2, and H+ ions) are all held relatively constant durign exercise
	- the changes occur too fast to result from the recptor pathways previously discusessed

### other factors that may increase ventillation during exercise

1. **reflexes origniating from body movements**
2. **increased body temperature**
3. **epinephrine release**
4. **impulses from the cerebral cortex**

### Apnea and dyspnea

- **apnea:** transiet disruption of ventillation, with breathing resuming sponteaneously
	- if breathing does not resume it is called **respiratory arrest**
	- sleep apnea is likely to occur because central chemoreceptors are less sensitive to changes in PCO2 during sleep

#### Dyspnea

- feeling short of breath
- often accompanies oobstructive lung disease or pulmonary oedema associated with congestive heart failure
- arises due to the discrepancy between repiratory want and respiratory get
- people with COPD cannot breath out enough (cannot get to even their elevated FRC during exercise) => causes dynamic hyperinflation of the lungs and dyspnea
