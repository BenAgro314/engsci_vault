## Gas Exchange

- oxegen diffuses from alveoli to blood 
- CO2 diffuses from blood to alveoli
- factors determining diffusion:
	- $\Delta P$: partial pressure gradient (not hydraulic pressure)
	- $R$: resistance (physical properties of gas and structures it is diffusing through)

### Diffusion at the alveolar-capillary membrane

Equations governing rate of Oxegen and CO2 diffusion our of the alveloi in the blood (across the membrane):

$$\dot{V}_{O_2} = (P_{A_{O2}} - P_{V_{O2}}) A/T$$

$$\dot{V}_{CO_2} = (P_{A_{CO2}} - P_{V_{CO2}}) A/T$$

where $\dot{V}_a$ is the rate of transfer of $a$ across the membrane. $P_{A_a}$ is the partial pressure of $a$ in the alveloi and $P_{V_a}$ is the partial pressure of $a$ in the vessels. Therefore resistance depends on 

- surface area $A$
- membrane thickness $T$
- diffusibility $D$ (reflecting solubility and molecular weight). This is ignored because it is a constant

### Partial Pressure Gradients

- diffusion occurs down a partial pressure gradient

#### Partial Pressures

- table with partial pressures for various gases:
- ![[Pasted image 20210409102113.png]]
- dry air is 79% nitrogen and 21% oxegen. Using the total atmospheric pressure of 760 mmHg you can find the partial pressures (
	- the partial pressure of all the constituant gases must add to the total pressure.
	- every gas molecule, regardless of it's size, exerts the same pressure
	- partial pressure is proportional to the percentage of gas in the mixture 
- $P_{CO2}$ in the atmosphere is $0.23 mmHg \approx 0$. 
- gases dissolved in a liquid also exert a partial pressure
- the greater the partial pressure, the more gas dissolved (this also depends on solutbility)
- CO2 is 20x as soluble as O2 in water

#### Partial Pressure Gradients

##### Alveolar Partial Pressures of O2 and CO2

- inspired air has a different composition
	- saturated with water vapor during inhilation -> partial pressure of H2O is 47 mmHg
	- partial pressures of O2 and N2 drop accordingly to 563 mmHG and 150 mmHg respectively
- alveolar partial pressure of oxegen is also lower than atmospheric because of mixture with unexpelled air from lungs (from dead space)
	- this causes a further drop in the partial pressure of oxegen to 100 mmHg
	- this can be calculated with
	-	$$P_{A_{O2}}  = P_{I_{O2}} - P_{A_{CO2}}/R$$
	-	$R = \dot{V}_{CO_2}/\dot{V}_{O_2}$ is the **respiratory quotient**, the ratio of metabolic CO2 production to oxygen consumption
	-	$R=0.8$ for a typical healthy person
	-	$P_{A_{CO2}} = 50 mmHG$ and $P_{I_{O2}} = 150 mmHg$ normally.
-	unexpectedly, the partial pressure of oxegen does not change signifigantly during inspiration/expiration
	-	only a small proportion of alveolar air exchanged each breath 
		-	mixing new air with larger volume means that partial pressure of oxegen rises only sightly
	-	there is a constant drive for oxegen to move down its concentration gradient -> partial pressure remains constant at about 100 mmHg throughout respiration
- the partial pressure of CO2 also remains relatively constant
	- constantly produced by tissues and transported to lungs via blood

##### Partial Pressure Gradients of Oxegen and Carbon Dioxide across Pulmonary Capillaries

- blood in pulmonary arteries: low partial pressure of O2 of 40 mmHg and high partial pressure of CO2 of 46 mmHg
- diffusion occurs with lungs until no gradient exists -> 100 mmHg for O2 in pulmonary veins after visiting the lungs (once returnign to heart) and 40 mmHg of CO2
- partial pressures can be expressed as mixed contents:
	- 40 mmHg of O2 -> 150 mL of O2/L of blood, while arteriolar blood has 200 ml of O2/L => only 25% of the oxegen is used at rest
	- the rest is an immediately available reserve
- CO2 that remains in the blood is important for regulating pH and stimulating respiration
- if tissues demand more O2 (say leaving the concentration gradient at 30 mmHg), there will be a large concentration gradient at the lungs => ensures more rapid diffusion back to 100 mmHg partial pressure of alveoli
- see figure below for summary of partial pressures:

![[Pasted image 20210409104621.png]]

- other factors can influence the high end (alveoli for O2 and blood for CO2) for the gradient of diffusion
	- ventillation of lungs $\dot{V}$
	- perfusion to lung regions $\dot{Q}$
	- with high $\dot{V}/Q$ => alvolar partial pressure for oxegen will by higher (the reverse is also true), increasing the gradient for diffusion
- CO2 does not needs as large of a concentration gradient as oxegen because it is 20 times more soluble 
- see figure below for factors that influence rate of gas transfer across alveolar-capillary membrane:

### Other Factors

- **ficks law** states that the rate of diffusion of a gas also depends on the surface area and thickness of the diffusive membrane. 

#### Effect of Surface Area and Membrane Thickness on Gas Exchange

- at rest some pulmonary capillaries are closed (at the top of the lung) because blood pressure is not high enough
- during exercise, these will open with the higher blood pressure and this increases the **surface area**, $A$, available for gas exchange. This also effecitvely reduces the diffusion distance $T$.
- alveolar membranes are also stretched during exercise => greater surface area
- **capillary transit time:** the amount of time blood stays in the capillaries.
	- at rest this is 0.75 s for pulmonary capillaries which is triple the time needed for equillibriating gas exchange
	- during maximal exercise this is reduce to 0.4 s which is still enough time due to increased $A$ and reduced $T$.
- exercise at altitude is difficult because of the reduced partial pressure of oxegen in the atmosphere => equillbirum may not be met during exercise
- see figure below for summary of the effects of lower atmospheric oxegen partial pressure and impaired diffusion on the rate and position of equillbrium
- ![[Pasted image 20210409105935.png]] 
- **Pathological conditions:**
	- **emphysema** reduces surface area when alveolar walls and capillaries are lost (larger but fewer chambers)
		- this can also result in regional lung collapse, **atelectasis**
		- this affects the diffusion of O2 more than CO2 due to solubility
	- thickened  membrane increases T and reduces diffusion rate:
		- **pulmonary odedema:** excess interstital fluid between capillaries and alveoli due to pulmonary inflamation or left sided congestive heart failure
		- **pulmonary fibrosis:** replacement of lung tissue with fibrous tissue in response to irritants
		- **pneumonia:** inflammation induced accumulation of fluid around alveoli. Usually bacterial or viral infection, asipiration of food, or chemical agents

#### Effect of Diffusion Coefficient on Gas Exchange

- rate of gas transfer is proportional to diffusion coefficient, $D$, relating the solutbilty of the gas in lung tissues and inversely proportional the the molecular weight
- This is 20 x higher for CO2 than O2

#### Alveolar Dead Space

- not all alveoli are ventillated and perfused equally
- **shunts** are alveoli that are perfused but not ventillated
- **alveolar dead space** consists of alveoli that are ventillated but not perfused
	-	this is small in regular people
- the combination of **anatomic** and **alveolar dead space** is called **physiologic dead space**

##### Regional Control of Ventillation and Diffusion

- resistance of individual airways can be adjusted in response to local changes in the partial pressure of CO2
- the resistance of individual blood vessels can be controlled in response to local changes in the partial pressure of oxegen

#### Effect of Oxegen

- oxygen delivered to a lung region is analagous to water flowing into a sink
- increase ventillation => more oxygen partial pressure (and the reverse is true). Analgous to filling the sink
- the rate that oxygen is removed from the lungs depends on the perfusion. analagous to the sink drain
- if ventillation to the lung region is low, the partial pressure of O2 falls, and this hypoxia causes constriction of the vascular smooth muscle supply the lung region (analagous to partially closing the sink drain
- this causes a regional rise in the partial pressure of oxygen
- the diverts blood to non-hypoxic regions 
- evidence that the reverse occurs is weaker
	- only way to increase the alveolar partial pressure of oxegen is to increase ventillation dispropotionately to metabolic demands, therby decrease the partial pressure of CO2 in the alveoli and ateries.
	-  this will increase the arterial pressure of oxygen.
	- this effect is modest however
- high regional levels of O2 in the alveoli should be though of as causing less valsconstriction, rather than causing vasodilation

#### Effect of CO2

- rate of CO2 removal depends on ventillation
- if perfusion in the lung region is low, the regional partial pressure of CO2 falls.
- This low partial pressure of CO2, **hypocapnia**, constricts smooth muscles in the airways supplying that lung region => dereases ventillation rate
- reduced ventillation of underperfused regions is diverted to better refused ones
- see figure below for a summary of the effects of O2 and CO2 on lung and blood vessel constriction

#### Gas Exchange Across the Systemic Capillaries

- O2 and CO2 move between systemic capillary blood and the tissue cells by simple diffusion
- no gas exchange occurs prior to these capillaries => the partial pressures are the same as in the pulmonary veins

#### $P_{O_2}$ and $P_{CO_2}$ Gradients Across Systemic Capillaries

- cellular partial pressures average 40 and 46 mmHg for O2 and CO2 respectively
- the partial pressures the systemic capillaries never quite euilibriate with the tissues because cells are constantly producing CO2 and consuming O2 => tissue partial pressure for oxegen is always slightly lower than that in the blood, tissue partial pressure for CO2 is always slightly higher than that in the blood
- as metabolism increases, so does the partial pressure gradients => increases amount of CO2 and O2 exchanged across membrane


#### Net diffusion of Oxegen and Carbon Dioxide Between the Alveoli and Tissues

-	O2: (ventillation) alveoli -> blood -> tissues (metabolism)
- CO2: (metabolism) tissues -> blood -> alveoli (ventillation)
