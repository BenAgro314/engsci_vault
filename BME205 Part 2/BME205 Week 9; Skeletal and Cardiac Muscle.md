# Skeletal and Caridac Muscle

##### Types of contraction

- **at the level of the muscle:**
	- **concentric:** muscle shortens as it contracts (**dynamic**)
	- **eccentric:** muscle elongates as it contracts (**dynamic**)
	- **isometric:** muscle maintains its length during contraction (**static**)

- **at the level of the muscle fiber:**
	- **isotonic:** constant tension with a change in length
	- **isometric:** constant tension with no change in length

- **origin:** the end of the muscle attached to the more stationary part of the skeleton
- **insertion:** the end of the muscle attached to the moving part of the skeleton
- not all skeletal muscles are attached to bone:
	- eye muscle go from skull to eye
	- sphincters are not attached to bone at either end
	- tounge has a free end



## Contraction Strength

1. number of muscle fibers contracting 
2. firing frequency of each contracting fiber
- these strategies are not used equally between muscles:
	- small muscle rely mroe on 2, while large muscle rely more on 1

### Factors affecting each fiber 

##### Single muscle twitch

![[timing.jpg]]

##### Twitch summation and Tetanus

- **tetanus:** rapid twich summation resulting in maximum tension for a muscle fiber

![[twitch-summation.jpg]]

- ~60 Hz nessecary for max force and 100 Hz nessecary for tetanus (depend on the person, 60 Hz may cause tetanus)
- 8 -12 Hz for sub-maximal contraction, 30 hz for moderate force
- **at the cellular level:**
	- if APs are at a low frequency, there is enough time for Ca2+ to be taken back into the SR -> no summation
	- if a second AP occurs while there is Ca2+ still in the cytosol -> permits more cross bridge cycling and summation 
	- with higher AP frequencies -> higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentration


##### Length tension relationship

![[length-tension.jpg]]

- at **optimal length**
	- maximal cross bridge binding sites are accesible to the myosin heads
	- optimal overlap between thick and thin filaments
	- only myosin tails are found in the region where the thin filaments do not overlap
- at lengths greater than optimal
	- decreased number of binding sites -> unused cross bridges -> less tension 
- at lengths less than optimal
	1. thin filaments from opposite sides of the sarcomere become overlapped -> limiting cross bridge ability to bind to actin
	2. ends of thick filaments are forced into Z lines
	3. not as much Ca2+ released and reduced ability to remove troponin-tropomyosin complex (for unknown reasons)

##### Fiber Diameter

- larger diameter -> higher maximum force generation
- **hypertrophy: ** enlaring myofibrils
- **hyperplasia:** more myofibrils. Occurs when Z-disc filaments snap

##### Fiber Type

|     | Slow - Oxidative (type 1) | Fast - oxidative (type 2A) | Fast Glycolytic (Type 2X)| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
Mitochondria | many | intermediate | few |
Capillaries | many | many | few |
Myoglobin content | high (red) | high (red) | low (white) |
Contractile velocity | slow | fast | fastest |
Rate of Fatigue | slow | medium | fast |
Diameter | small | large | large |
size of innervating motor neuron | smallest | medium | largest |

##### Fatigue

### Number of active fibers (per motor unit) and number of active motor units

- **motor unit:** one motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates.
- the order of motor unit recruitment depends on the **size principle:** larger motor units are activated later
- also depends on type.
	- Type 1 -> Type 2A -> Type 2X are activated in that order (whith increasing exertion)
- **asynchronous stimulation of motor units** is used to prevent fatigue if the load is not too large

##### Velocity of shortening

- force and velocity are inversely related for concentric contractions
![[Pasted image 20210327122158.png]]
- force and velocity are inversely related for eccentric contractions

##### Heat

- muscles do work and thus generate heat
- in an isotonic contraction, muscle efficiency is about 25 percent (75 percent goes to heat)
- this helps maintain body temperature

##### Levers 

- **fulcrum:** joint that the lever arm rotates around
- **power arm:** between the fulcrum and where the load is applied
- **load arm:** between the fulcrum and the load
- **lever ratio = power arm/load arm**
- distance moved at muscle end =  (distance moved at load end) x (lever ratio)
- force at load end end = (lever ratio) x (force at muscle end)

### ATP and fiber types

### Contracile use of ATP
1. splitting ATP on the myosin heads by myosin ATPase provides energy to cock the myson heads
2. binding of fresh ATP molcule allows cross bridges to release from actin filaments
3. active transport of Ca2+ back into SR allows for relaxation

### Fatigue 

- **muscle fatigue:**
	- local increase in ADP and inorganic phosphate interfers with cross bridge cycling and blocks Ca2+ reuptake into SR
	- accumulation of lactic acid inhibits key enzymes in the energy producing pathways
	- accumulation of extracellular K+ (Na+ - K+ pump cant work quickly enough) causes local reduction in membrane potential -> decreased release of Ca2+ intercellularly by imparing coupling of voltage gated dihydropyridine receptors in the T-tubules and the Ca2+ release channels in the SR
	- depletion of glucose energy reserves 

- **central fatigue:**
	- CNS no longer adequetely acivates the motor neurons supplying the working muscles 

- **neuromusclar fatigue**
	-  inability to produce ACh fast enough in a motor neuron
	-  does not occur under normal physiological conditions

### Muscle fiber types within a single motor unit

- skeletal muscle fibers are innervated by alpha motor neurons
- different alpha motor neurons innervate type 1 and type 2 fibers
- **type 1**
	- slow twitch
	- innervated by alpha 2 motor neurons (smaller than alpha 1 motor neurons)
	- **type 1 (slow) oxidative**
			- lots of mitochondria
			- lost of myoglobin (red)
			- large capillary supply
- **type 2**
	- innervated by alpha 1 motor neurons (which are larger than alpha 2 motor neurons)
	- the smaller the neuron, the lower the activation threshold and the slower the conduction velocity of that motor unit
	- contraction velocity approximately 10x faster than slow twitch
	- note: the oxidative <-> glycolytic distinction is a spectrum not a binary: all muscle fibers produce energy in both of these ways
	- **type 2 (fast) oxidative**
		- lots of mitochondria
		- lost of myoglobin (red)
		- large capillary supply
	- **type 2 (fast) gyloclytic**
		- small capillary supply
		- lots of stored glycogen
		- lots of enzymes for glycolysis
