# Tutorial 6

- Ach is released from axon terminals at NMJ
- AChE is an enzyme that sits on the muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) and deactivates ACh
- botulim toxin blocks the release of ACh

# Tutorial 7

- heart valves close and open due to pressure differences on the two sides of the valve
- the first heart sound occurs when the AV valves (mitral and tricuspid) close at the onset of ventricular systole
- insufficient AV valve -> does not close properly during systole -> there will be backflow into the atria (produces a gurgling systolic murmur)
- stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of each ventricle (EDV - ESV)
- cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate
- papillary muscles function to stop the AV valves from inverting
- damage to the left papillary muscles would mean that the left AV valve (mitral) could invert
- mitral valve prolapse allows blood to flow out of the left ventricle to the left atrium during systole
- mitral valve prolaps does not change stroke volume	
- this reduced **forward stroke volume and forward cardiac output (ie to the aorta)**
	- this reduces systolic blood pressure
	- HR will raise to compensate
- pulmonary blood pressure will increase due to backflow
- this will cause more fluid to leave the capillaries in the lungs and enter the air sacks -> wet breath sounds
- decreased blood pressure will cause flitration in the kidneys to decrease and potentially lead to kidney failure

# Tutorial 8

- fetal heart capillaries receive oxegen from the placenta
- fetal heart adaptations
1. umbilical vein
	- carries oxegenated blood from the placenta back towards the liver area
	- at the umbilical vein, it can either go through all the capillaries in the liver, or take a shortcut through the ductus venous
2. dutus venous
	- this is shortcut to the inferior vena cava
	- this partially oxegenates the blood from the lower extremities
	- dumps blood into right atrium
	- blood in the right atrium can go to the right ventricle -> pulmonary artery -> lungs
	- the lung air sacs are full of fluid with little blood vessels going past them
	- the means there is not much oxegen
		- this causes hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
		- this leads to high resistance in the lungs and high blood pressure (P = QR)
		- this means there is a lot of pressure in the right atrium and right ventricle (right side of heart)
		- this causes blood to flow from the right atrium across the **foramen ovale** to the left atrium
3. Foramen ovale
	- not much blood comes back through the pulmonary veins, so blood flow coming from right atrium helps to replace this
	- blood is squeezed from the left ventricle into the aorta
4. Ductus arteriosus
	- allows blood to go from the pulmonary artery to the aorta
	- there are high pressures in the pulmonary artery
5. Umbilical Artery
	- a major branch off of the internal illiac arteries
	- returns blood back to the placenta
	- placenta has a very low resistance
	- this causes blood to divert towards it

- a ventricle septal defect allows blood flow from left to right ventricle
- this increases the blood flow to the right ventricle and thus to the lungs -> congestion due to high blood pressure in pulmonary arteries
