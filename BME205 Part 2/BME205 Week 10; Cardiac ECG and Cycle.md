# Cardiac ECG and Cycle

### Heart Rate Modulation

ways to decrease heart rate (opposite to increase):

- **decreased rate of depolarization (pacemaker potential slope)**

- **negative shift in resting membrane potential**

- **increased threshold potential**

### The ECG

- stands for **electrocardiogram**
- twelve electrode configuration
- three (for simplicity):

- A **depolarization moving towards a positive electrode** produces an upward deflection on the ECG 
	- we subtract $V_{\text{negative electrode}} - V_{\text{positive electrode}} = V_{A} - V_{B}$
- $R_{AB}$ is the resistance of the gap junctinon between cells
- A **depolarization moving towards a negative electrode** produces a downward deflection on the ECG
- A **repolarization moving towards a positive electrode** produces a downwards deflection on the ECG
- A **repolarization moving towards a negative eletrode** produces a positive deflection on the ECG

##### Sequence of depolarization

1. Depolarization of atria
	- SA node -> atrial pathways (interatrial and internodal pathways) -> Atrioventricular node and left atrium

2. Depolarization of septum from left to right
	- AV node -> bundle of his -> purkinje fiber system

3. Depolarization of anteroseptal region of myocardium towards apex
	- purkinje system -> ventricular muscle

4. Depolarize bulk of ventricular myocardium, from endocardium (inside of heart), to epicardium (outer layer)
	- prukinje system -> ventricular muscle

5. Depolarization of posterior portion of base of left ventricle

6. Ventricles are fully depolarized
