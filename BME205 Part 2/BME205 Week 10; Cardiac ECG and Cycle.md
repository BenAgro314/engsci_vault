# Cardiac ECG and Cycle

### Heart Rate Modulation

ways to decrease heart rate (opposite to increase):

- **decreased rate of depolarization (pacemaker potential slope)**

- **negative shift in resting membrane potential**

![[Pasted image 20210328094146.png]]

- **increased threshold potential**

### The ECG

- stands for **electrocardiogram**
- records electrical activity induced in body fluids that reaches the surface of the skin
- overall electrical activity, not a single action potential
- represents the comparison of voltages between two electrodes -> movements of depolarizations and repolarizations causes deflections, not overall depolarizations themselves
- each pair of connections is called **lead**
	- conventional ECGs use a 12 lead system

- **P wave**: atrial depolarization
- **QRS complex**: ventricular depolarization (hiding atrial repolarization)
- **T wave**: ventricular repolarization
- **AV nodal delay** is represented in the PR segment (note PQ is not used because Q can be hard to identify). Current is flowing through the AV node but it is too small to detect
- **Ventricular plateau during contraction** is represented by ST segment
- **passive ventricular filling** is represent by the TP interval.

- A **depolarization moving towards a positive electrode** produces an upward deflection on the ECG 
	- we subtract $V_{\text{negative electrode}} - V_{\text{positive electrode}} = V_{A} - V_{B}$
- $R_{AB}$ is the resistance of the gap junctinon between cells
- A **depolarization moving towards a negative electrode** produces a downward deflection on the ECG
- A **repolarization moving towards a positive electrode** produces a downwards deflection on the ECG
- A **repolarization moving towards a negative eletrode** produces a positive deflection on the ECG

##### Sequence of depolarization


1. Depolarization of atria
	- SA node -> atrial pathways (interatrial and internodal pathways) -> Atrioventricular node and left atrium

![[Pasted image 20210328095534.png]]
2. Depolarization of septum from left to right
	- AV node -> bundle of his -> purkinje fiber system

3. Depolarization of anteroseptal region of myocardium towards apex
	- purkinje system -> ventricular muscle 

![[Pasted image 20210328095805.png]]

4. Depolarize bulk of ventricular myocardium, from endocardium (inside of heart), to epicardium (outer layer)
	- prukinje system -> ventricular muscle

5. Depolarization of posterior portion of base of left ventricle

![[Pasted image 20210328100016.png]]

6. Ventricles are fully depolarized

![[Pasted image 20210328100048.png]]

7. Ventricle start to depolarize (from epicardium to endocardium)
	- note: epicaridum (outer layer) **depolarizes last and repolarizes first**
	- note: endocardium (inner layer) **depolarizes first and repolarizes last**

**ECG Trace:** Imagine placing a positive electrode at the heart apex and a negative electrode near the right atrium:
![[Pasted image 20210328100600.png]]


1. **Depolariation of atria:** SA node to AV node move depolarization towards positive electrode, produces P wave:
![[Pasted image 20210328100658.png]]

2. **Depolarization of septum from left to right produces Q wave**
 ![[Pasted image 20210328100818.png]]
 
3. **Ventricular Depolarization:** depolarization down towards apex produces R wave:
![[Pasted image 20210328100954.png]]
- Note that the repolarization of the atria is hidden due to this big signal

4. **Ventricular Depolarization:** depolarization from apex upwards to base of ventricles creates S wave

![[Pasted image 20210328101045.png]]

5. Plateau phase of the ventricular myocytes corresponds to the ST segment on the ECG (depolarization but no movement)

![[Pasted image 20210328101249.png]]
 
 5. **Ventricular Repolarization:** repolarizes from epicardium to endocardium -> repolarization moving away from + electrode -> positive T wave deflection: 

![[Pasted image 20210328101207.png]]

- if you are hit in the heart right around the start of the T wave it can cause ventricular fibrillation (**commotio cordis**)
	- electrical disturbance is caused by gap junction interferance

### Mechanical Events of the Cardiac Cycle 

- **systole:** contraction
- **diastole:** relaxation
- these terms are usually used to refer to ventricular systole and diastole

##### Pathway of blood flow through the heart:

![[Pasted image 20210328102742.png]]

- the three arteries on the aorta are (in order of blood flow)
	- Brachiocephalic artery (right arm, head and neck)
	- left common carotid
	- left subclavian

##### Major Events of Cardiac Cycle

1. **A. Mid ventricular diastole (diastasis)** 
	- atrium is also in diastole
	- TP interval on ECG
	- blood flows from vena cava, to atrium to ventricles (at a decreasing rate as pressure equalizes)
2. **B. Late ventriclar diastole (atrial ejection)**
	- SA node reaches threshold and fires -> P wave
	- atrial depolarization -> atrial contraction -> blood ejected from atria to ventricles
3. **End of ventricular diastole:**
	- **end diastolic volume (EDV)**
	- averages 135 ml
4. **Ventricular Excitation and onset of ventricular systole**
	- ventricular depolarization (QRS) -> ventricular contraction	
	- forces AV valves (mitral and tricuspid) closed
5. **C. Isovolumetric ventricular contraction**
	- both the AV values and semilunar valves are closed while the ventricles begin to contract
	- this period of contraction is isovolumetric
	- ends once the pressure in the ventricles is greater than that in the aorta/pulmonary ateries -> semilunar valves will open
	- pressure increase, volume constant
6. **D. Ventricular Ejection**
	- once semilunar valves open -> blood ejected from ventricles into arteries
	- amount of blood pumped out of each ventricle with each contraction is called the **stroke volume**, which is usually around 70 ml at rest
	- aortic pressure rises as blood enter is faster than it drains into aterioles
7. **End of ventricular systole**
	- ventricle does not empty completely during systole
	- amount of blood left is called the **end systolic volume (ESV)**
	- This averages 65 ml at rest
	- $SV = EDV - ESV$
8. **Ventricular Repolarization and onset of ventricular diastole**
	- T wave
	- as ventricles start to relax -> semilunary valves close
	- closure of aortic valve produces a disturbance in the pressure curve called the **dicrotic notch**
9. **E. Isovolumetric ventricular relaxation**
	- both mitral and aortic valves are closed for a time until the ventricular pressure drops below the atrial pressure
	- during this period, the ventricles are relaxing and the pressure is droping but the volume remains constant
10. **Ventricular Filling**
	-
