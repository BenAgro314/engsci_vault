# Cardiac Regulation and Vascular Physiology

##### Terms and Equations

- **SV:** stroke volume - the amount of blood outputed by each ventricle per contraction
- **EDV:** end diastolic volume (right before and during isovolumetric contraction)
- **ESV:** end systolic volume (rigth before and during isovolumentric relaxation)
- **CO:** cardiac output
- **HR:** heart rate in beat per minute **(bpm)**

All numbers below are averages at rest:
$$HR \approx 70 \text{  bpm}$$
$$EDV \approx 135 \text{   ml}$$
$$ESV \approx 65 \text{   ml}$$
$$SV = EDV-ESV \text{   [ml]} \approx 70 \text{  ml}$$
$$CO = SV \times HR \text{   [ml/min]} \approx 4900 \text{   ml/min}$$

note: average aortic flow rate is 4900 ml/min, which of course equals the cardiac output (this is usually rounded to 5 L/min)

##### Autonomic effects on the heart

- signals originate in the cardiovascular control center in the medulla of the brain stem
- the sympathetic neurons:
	- brain stem -> symapthic chain ganglia -> SA node, AV node and **ventricular myocytes**
- the parasympathetic neurons:
	- brain stem -> (via vagus nerve) -> SA node, **atrial myocytes** and AV node

##### Parasympathetic

- **decreases HR**
- The **vagus nerve decreases heart rate by:**
	- **hyperpolarization of the SA node**
		-  achieved by making the cell more permiable to pottassium -> move toward potassium equillibrium potential -> hyperpolarization	
		- this happens when ACh bind to the M2 muscarinic receptor -> enhanced K+ permiability
	- **decreased slope/rate of pacemaker potential in SA node** -> lower rate of AP generation
		- enhanced k+ permiability -> opposes funny current ($I_f$)(Na influx) -> slower pacemaker potential 

##### Sympathetic

- **increases HR**
- **steepen pacemaker potential** (get to threshold more quickly)
	- NE binds to beta 1 adrenergic receptor -> increases $I_f$ current (funny current)
- **lowering threshold potential** -> increased rate of AP generation
	- increased Ca2+ currents effectively makes Ca2+ voltage gated channels more active and threshold potential is lowered
- think: increased sympathetic -> increased Ca2+
- increased conduction velocity through AV node (reduced delay due to higher calcium concentrations)
- increases conduction velocity through purkinje fibers

##### Autonomic Tone

- baseline level of stimulation via sympathetic and parasympathetic systems

- the intrinsic rate of the SA node is higher than the resting heart rate of people (ie **if you cut the nerves to the heart**, you heart rate would rise to the intrinsic rate 70 bpm-> 100-110 bpm (**natural myogenic rate**)
- this is because parasympthetic tone levels reduce the resting heart rate from this intrinsic rate

##### Stroke Volume

- **length tension relationship in cardiac muscle:*

![[Pasted image 20210328122935.png]]

- heart muscle never operates at lengths greater than 100 percent of $L_{optimal}$ (only in diseased hearts)
	- pericardial sac prevents over-stretching

##### Frank-Starling Law

- **the more you stretch the heart, the greater force/pressure it can generate**
- **determines intrinisic control of stroke volume**

![[Pasted image 20210328123412.png]]
- at normal EDV, the force generated via ventricular contraction is less than maximum 
- as EDV increases, the force the heart generates increases due to this **intrinsic length tension relationship**

##### Extrinsic Control of heart rate
- Parasympathetic 
- sympathetic

##### Extrinsic control of stroke volume
- sympathetic (only it directly innervates the ventricles)
	- **enhanced Ca2+ permeability**
	- NE and some E
	- increased Ca2+ currents and availability in cytosol of ventricular myocytes -> increased force developed by ventricular myocytes and the force of ventricular contraction
	- **Shifts frank-starling curve**

##### Intrinsic control of heart rate

- without any innervation, the SA pacemaker will cause the heart to beat at around 100 - 110 bpm (no tone)

##### Intrinsic Controls of stroke volume
- symathetic stimulation also causes arterial and venous vasoconstriction -> increased venous return -> increased end diastolic volume -> increased force of contraction (this is a pathway that relies on intrinsic controls of stroke volume)
