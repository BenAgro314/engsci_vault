# Cardiac Regulation and Vascular Physiology

##### Terms and Equations

- **SV:** stroke volume - the amount of blood outputed by each ventricle per contraction
- **EDV:** end diastolic volume (right before and during isovolumetric contraction)
- **ESV:** end systolic volume (rigth before and during isovolumentric relaxation)
- **CO:** cardiac output
- **HR:** heart rate in beat per minute **(bpm)**

All numbers below are averages at rest:
$$HR \approx 70 \text{  bpm}$$
$$EDV \approx 135 \text{   ml}$$
$$ESV \approx 65 \text{   ml}$$
$$SV = EDV-ESV \text{   [ml]} \approx 70 \text{  ml}$$
$$CO = SV \times HR \text{   [ml/min]} \approx 4900 \text{   ml/min}$$

note: average aortic flow rate is 4900 ml/min, which of course equals the cardiac output (this is usually rounded to 5 L/min)

**Two determinates of cardiac output:**** stroke volume** and **heart rate**

##### Autonomic control of the heart

- signals originate in the cardiovascular control center in the medulla of the brain stem
- the sympathetic neurons:
	- brain stem -> symapthic chain ganglia -> SA node, AV node and **ventricular myocytes**
- the parasympathetic neurons:
	- brain stem -> (via vagus nerve) -> SA node, **atrial myocytes** and AV node

#### Control of heart rate

##### Parasympathetic Affect on HR

- **decreases HR**
- **SA Node**: 
	- The **vagus nerve decreases heart rate by:** slowing the closure of K+ channels. This results in:
		- **hyperpolarization of the SA node**
			- more K+ leaves the cell that normal -> hyperpolarization
			-  also, the cell is generally more permeable to potassion ->  move toward potassium equillibrium potential -> hyperpolarization	
			- this happens when ACh bind to the M2 muscarinic receptor -> enhanced K+ permiability
		- **decreased slope/rate of pacemaker potential in SA node** -> lower rate of AP generation
			- enhanced k+ permiability -> opposes funny current ($I_f$)(Na influx) -> slower pacemaker potential 
	- **AV Node**
		- decreases excitability -> longer AV delay
		- brought about by increasing K+ permeability which hyperpolarizes the membrane and slows the initiation of action potentials
	- **Atrial contractile cells:**
		- reduces slow inward Calcium current -> shortened AP
	- **No affect on ventricles**

![[Pasted image 20210328162247.png]] (note, ignore the part where it says sympathetic stimulatio naffects the atrial muscle)

##### Sympathetic affect on HR 

- **increases HR**
- **SA Node**
	- **steepen pacemaker potential** (get to threshold more quickly)
		- NE binds to beta 1 adrenergic receptor -> increases $I_f$ current (funny current)
	- **lowering threshold potential** -> increased rate of AP generation
		- increased Ca2+ currents effectively makes Ca2+ voltage gated channels more active and threshold potential is lowered
- **AV Node:**
	- decreases delay by increasing conduction velocity (enhancing slow inward Ca2+ current)
- **Ventricular Muscle Cells**
	- increases contraction strength by increasing Ca2+ permeability -> enhances slow Ca2+ influx and enhanced Ca2+ participation in excitation coupling
- think: increased sympathetic -> increased Ca2+
- increased conduction velocity through AV node (reduced delay due to higher calcium concentrations)
- increases conduction velocity through **purkinje fibers**
- **epiniphrine** reinforces the sympathetic nervous system's effect on the heart by brining about similar effects to NE

##### Autonomic Tone

- baseline level of stimulation via sympathetic and parasympathetic systems

![[Pasted image 20210328122638.png]]

- the intrinsic rate of the SA node is higher than the resting heart rate of people (ie **if you cut the nerves to the heart**, you heart rate would rise to the intrinsic rate 70 bpm-> 100-110 bpm (**natural myogenic rate**)
- this is because parasympthetic tone levels reduce the resting heart rate from this intrinsic rate

#### Control of Stroke Volume

##### Intrinsic Control 

- the heart has the ability to regulat its own stroke volume via intrisic length-tension relationships described by  the **frank-starling law**
- **length tension relationship in cardiac muscle:*

![[Pasted image 20210328122935.png]]

- heart muscle never operates at lengths greater than 100 percent of $L_{optimal}$ (only in diseased hearts)
	- pericardial sac prevents over-stretching

![[Pasted image 20210328123140.png]]

###### Frank-Starling Law

- **the more you stretch the heart, the greater force/pressure it can generate**
	- stretching occurs due to diastolic filling => a greater EDV -> greater force can be generated -> greater stroke volume
	- the larger the **preload** (amount that flows into the ventricles during diastole), the creater the force generated
- this mechanism allows for balanced output between the two sides of the heart
	-  if the right side of the heart was ejecting more blood, more would enter the left side -> more would leave the left side -> balance
-  If venous return is increased, the strength of contraction and thus the stroke volume can also be increased 
- **determines intrinisic control of stroke volume**

![[Pasted image 20210328123412.png]]
- at normal EDV, the force generated via ventricular contraction is less than maximum 
- as EDV increases, the force the heart generates increases due to this **intrinsic length tension relationship**
- this relationship is caused by
	- **degree of overlap between thick and thin filaments**
	- **myofilament Ca2+ sensitive depends on fibers length**
		- when the muscle is more stretched, the myofilaments are pulled closed together-> more cross bridge activity when Ca2+ is present

##### Extrinsic control of stroke volume
- sympathetic (only it directly innervates the ventricles)
	- **increases contractility of ventricles by**
		- **enhanced Ca2+ permeability** and **Ca2+ influx** -> myocardial fibers can generate more force (greater cross bridge cycling)
	- NE and some E
	- increased Ca2+ currents and availability in cytosol of ventricular myocytes -> increased force developed by ventricular myocytes and the force of ventricular contraction
	- Symapthetic stimulation **shifts the frank-starling curve**

![[Pasted image 20210328123920.png]]

##### Intrinsic control of heart rate

- without any innervation, the SA pacemaker will cause the heart to beat at around 100 - 110 bpm (no tone)

##### Intrinsic Controls of stroke volume
- symathetic stimulation also causes arterial and venous vasoconstriction -> increased venous return -> increased end diastolic volume -> increased force of contraction (this is a pathway that relies on intrinsic controls of stroke volume)

### Smooth Muscle and Blood Vessel

- locations of smooth muscle
	- skin
	- hollow organs
	- blood vessels
	- eyes
	- tracts (reproductive)
	- use acronym STOVE

![[Pasted image 20210328124641.png]]

### Smooth Muscle

![[Pasted image 20210328164239.png]]
- small unstriated cells
- three filament types
	- thick myosin filaments (longer than those in skeletal muscle)
	- thin actin filaments (which lack toponin but have tropomyosin)
	- intermediate filaments that are part of the cytoskeleton and maintain cell shape
- instead of sarcomeres or z-lines, smooth muscle has **dense bodies**
	- held in place by intermediate filaments
	- actin is anchored to dense bodies
	- create a diamond shaped contracile lattice (see picture
- **light chains** (light-weight protein chains) are attached to the heads of the myosin molecules
	- can only interact with actin when this chain is phosphorlylated
	- during excitation, intracellular Ca2+ acts as a messenger that results in phosphorlyation of this light chain
		- Ca2+ -> **calmodulin** (intracellular protein) -> **myosin light chain kinase**  which phorphorlylates the light chain
- no **t-tubules** and poorly developed **SR**
	- most Ca2+ enters from ECF
	- small amount from SR when external Ca2+ influx happens
	- Ca2+ is removed via active transport back into SR
- no tendons, attached to one another via connective tissues
- one innervating neuron will stimulate many smooth muscle cells via a web of **varicosities**
	- the varicosities release neurotransmitter onto the smooth muscle cells
	- parasympathic: ACh
	- sympathetic: NE

##### Multiunit Smooth Muscle

- contraction is **neurogenic** (nerve produced)
- innervated by autonomic system (involuntary)
1. walls of large blood vessels
2. small airways in lungs
3. eye muscles that adjust long and short range focus
4. air folicles that cause goosebumps
- not connected via gap junctions 
- finer control over contraction 

##### Single Unit Smooth Muscle

- connected via **gap junctions **
- contract as one unit due to Ca2+ conduction
- behaves like one unit known as a **functional syncytium**

![[Pasted image 20210328164211.png]]

	
- autonomic innvervation changes the **availability of Ca2+ in the cytosol of smooth muscle cells** -> can modulate the strength of contraction
- **smooth muscle cells have a base level of autonomic tone** due to a consistant level of Ca2+ in the cytosol -> maintain a low level of tension
	- sensitive to innervation depending on distribution of cholinergic and adrenergic receptors

![[Pasted image 20210328165358.png]]

##### Spontaneous Depolarization (Myogenic Activity) of Single Unit Smooth Muscle 

- single units mooth muscle is **self excitable**
- only some non-contracile cells in the functional synctium are myogenic pacemaker cells (**not all smooth muscle**)
- **two types of self excitability**
1. **pacemaker potential**

![[Pasted image 20210328125619.png]]

2. **slow wave potential** (achieved by changing rate of Na+ active transport)

![[Pasted image 20210328125657.png]]
- whether an action potential is achieved depends on the starting point of the sinusoid 
	- this is a function of neural and local factors

- notice time scale is in minutes on both of these graphs 

##### Gradation of Single Unit Smooth Muscle Contraction

- cannot vary the number of cells that contract
- gradation is achieved by **varying cytosolic Ca2+ concentration**

##### Smooth Muscle Tone

- most smooth muscle has a sufficient Ca2+ concentration at normal "resting" conditions to have a low leve of tension known as **tone**

##### Innervation by autonomic nervous system

-  nerves do not initiate contraction in single unit smooth muscle, but modify the strength and rate of contraction
	-  either enhance or depress the inherent contratile activity of the functional synctium
-  a single autonomic neuron branches across the surface of many smooth muscle cells and releases neurotransmitters from varicosities

![[Pasted image 20210328174415.png]]

- each autonomic terminal can influence more than one smooth muscle cell
- each smooth muscle cell may be influenced by more than one neurotransmitter

##### Tension and Relaxation

- smooth muscle can develop tension even when signifigantly stretched
	- this means hollow organs can accomidate signifigant changes in volume (e.g stomach)
- smooth muscle cells are inherently relaxed when stretched
	- **stress relaxation response:** smooth muscle cross bridges detached relatively slowly 
	- when smooth muscle is suddenly stretch, cross bridges detach and slide into an unstrained position, restoring the tension to the original value
	- this means that the contents of hollow organs can be under constant pressure even when the organ is stretched more

##### Slow and Economical

- smooth muscle contracts more slowly than skeletal muscle, but can generate the same amount of force for less ATP use
	- **latch phenomenon** enables smooth muscle to maintain tension for less ATP use

##### Vessel System 	

- systemic veins have the largest capacity because they are the most distensable 

![[Pasted image 20210328125847.png]]

- larger arteries have lots of elastic fibers -> not as distensible 
- **endothelium:** inner layer the blood interfaces with
- **capillaires** are all endothelium
- **large veins** have collagen but not much elastin -> like a shopping bag

![[Pasted image 20210328175300.png]]

- blue lines in the below photo represent elastin

![[Pasted image 20210328161032.png]]

##### Systemic vascular resistance

- no parasympathetic innervation to arterioles
- always some level of **sympathetic tone**
	- **vasodilation**: relax smooth muscle -> wider radius
		- lower sympathetic stimulation
		- lower myogenic activity
		- lower O2 content
		- higher CO2 content and other metabolites
		- increased nitrous oxide NO
		- hitamine release
		- heat
	- **vasoconstriction**: contract smooth muscle -> smaller radius
		- higher sympathetic stimulation
		- higher myogenic activity
		- higher O2 content
		- lower CO2 content and other metabolites
		- increased endothelin
		- vasopressin; angiotensin II
		- cold
