**Textbook sections:** 3.1 - 3.7

### Organization of the Nervous System (92-93)

The nevous system has two main divisions that continue downards in a tree like structure:
1. **CNS**
	- brain
	- spinal cord
2. **PNS**
	- afferent division
		- sensory stimuli
		- viseral stimuli
	- efferent division
		- somatic 
			- motor neurons 
				- skeletal muscles
		- autonomic (both divisions innvervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, exocrine glands, and some endrocrine glands)
			- sympathetic
			- parasympathetic 

##### Classes of Neurons

- **afferent neurons**
	- **unipolar**
	- **long** peripheral axon (**afferent fiber**)
	- **short central axon** from the cell body to the spinal cord (**proximal end**)
	- **sensory receptor** or synapse with specialzed receptor at distal end
	- synapse with interneuron in the spinal cord
	- cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion
	- travel up the dorsal root with synapses in the dorsal horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord
- **efferent neurons**
	- cell bodies in the CNS (ventral horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord)
	- multipolar
	- efferent fibers travel out of the CNS to muscles, glands, or ganglia
- **interneurons**
	- about 99% of neurons are interneurons
	- ~100 billion interneurons in the CNS
	- usually bipolar
	- connect afferent and efferent neurons

	- cerebral cortex
		1. sensory **perception**
		2. voluntary motor control
		3. language 
		4. personality

	2. cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive control center
	3. muscle reflexes for posture and equillibrium
	4. reception of all synaptic input from the spinal cord.
	5. **reticular formation** plays a role in cortical alterness
	6. role in sleep-wake cycle

### 3.3 Protection of The CNS (95-100)

90 percent of the cells in the CNS are **glial cells**, however they only occupy half of the brain volume because they do not branch as much as neurons do.

**Glial cells** serve as connective tissue for the CNS, supporting neurons metabolically and physically. 

##### Astrocytes 

1. physically support neurons with their podocytes (maintain spatial relationships)
2. assist in **neural scar formation** after injury and repair of brain injuries
3. act as scaffolding during fetal brain development
4. guide and induce the capillaries to form the **blood brain barrier** (BBB)
5. take up excess K+ from the ECF during periods of high neuronal activity
6. take up and degrade neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate
7. enhance synpase formation. 
	- They can communicate with neurons and themselves with gap junctions.
	- they have receptors for some neurotransmitters like glutamate 
	- They can also communicate via **K+ wave propogation**: astrocytes respond to glutamate or ATP released by neurons, causing K+ influx into the cell. This intracellular rise in K+ prompts the astrocyte to release ATP, activating adjacent glial cells. 
	- they can release other neurotransmitters, similar to neurons

##### Oligodendrocytes

Create the myelin sheaths around neurons in the CNS. 

##### Microglia

- immune cells of the CNS
- at rest, they release *nerve growth factor* which helps neurons and other glial cells thrive and survive
- if there is a foreign invader in the CNS, the microglia retract their branches and release descructive enzymes on their target (they are **phagocytic**)

##### Ependymal cells

- line the fluid cavities of the CNS (ventricals and spinal cord)
- **ventricals:** four interconnected chambers in the brain. 
- **central canal:** fluid filled tunnel that travels down the middle of the spinal cord.
- help form the cerebrospinal fluid (the **choroid plexus** secretes new CSF and consists of modified ependymal cells surrounding a core of cappilaries and connective tissue)
- bear **cilia** which beat (via the protein **dynein**) to move CSF through the ventricles.
- may act as **neural stem cells** with the potential to form new neurons

**Meniginomas** are tumors of glial cells that originate in the brain (neurons themselves cannot cause tumors because they cannot divide).

##### Protection of the nervous tissue

- hard bone (the **cranium** and **vertebral column**)
- three protective layers known as the **meningies**
- brain floats on the **CSF**, which acts a cushion
- **BBB** limits access of blood-borne materials into the vunerable brain tissues

##### Meningieal Membranes

1. **Dura mater**
	- tough outermost layer 
	- inelastic
	- somtimes seperates from arachnoid mater to form **dural sinuses** or (in the case of larger cavities) **venous sinuses**
	- venous blood draining from the brain and CSF returns to the blood stream through these sinuses. 
2. **Arachnoid Mater**
	- cobweb appearance
	- richly vascularized
	- space between arachnoid mater and pia mater forms the subarachnoid space which is filled with CSF
	- **Arachnoid Vili** penetrate through gaps in the overlyind dura mater to return CSF back to the blood circulating the in sinuses 
3. **Pia mater**
	- most fragile layer
	- highly vascular
	- adheres directly to brain and spinal cord
	- dips down brain folds to bring a rich blood supply in close contact with the ependymal cells lining the ventricals.

##### CSF

- surrounds and cushions the brain
- same density as brain, neutral buoyancy 
- major function is to serve a shock absorber
- NOT brain intersitial fluid, but the brain intersitial fluid is heaviy influenced by the composition of the CSF
- formed by the **choroid plexus**
	- vascular pia matter dips into pockets of ependymal cells
- composition of CSF is lower in K+ and higher in Na+ to promote neuronal activity. 

##### Flow of CSF

1. formed by choroid plexus (there a multiple in different ventricles)
2. circulates through ventricles
3. exits fourth ventricle at the base of the brain
4. flows in the subarachnoid space between the meningial layers
5. reabsorbed from the subarachoid space into the venous blood across the subarachnoid villi

**hydrocephalus** occurs when there is too much CSF (pressure is too high), which can result in brain damage. 

##### BBB

- consists of endothelial cells with tight junctions, forcing materials from the blood to pass through the cells of the capillaries
- transport of anything that is not a small water soluble substance or a lipid soluble substance occurs through highly selective membrane-bound carries
- *"Transport across the brain capillary walls is anatomically prevented between the cells and is physiologically restricted through the cells."*
- Astrocytes surround areas with a BBB and attach to the cappilaries with their podocytes. 
	- they signal cells forming the capillaries to make tight junctions 
	- participate in the cross cellular transport of some substances like K+

**circumventricular organs** are areas of the brain where blood is sampled for homostatic purposes, and thus there is no BBB. 

##### Oxegen and Glucose in the brain

- the brain can only perform aerobic respiration
- **neuroglobin** is the oxegen carring molecule in the brain tissue
- the brain only uses **glucose** as a fuel source


### 3.4 Spinal Cord (100-109)

##### Vertebral Canal

- spinal cord travels down vertbral canal
- 31 pairs of spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord through the arches of adjacent vertebrae
- 8 cervial (neck) nerves
- 12 thoracic (chest) nerves
- 5 lumbar (abdominal) nerves
- 5 sarcal (pelvic) nerves
- 1 coccygeal (tailbone) nerve
- most spinal nerves must travel for some distance down the vertebral column before emerging (the vertegral column is longer than the spinal cord)
- The **cauda equina** is the thick bundle of nerves within the lower vertebral canal
- **spinal taps** obtain a sample of the CSF below the level of the second lumbar vertebrae to prevent any rist of penetrating the spinal cord 

##### Grey and White Matter

- **white matter** surround the grey matter in the spinal cord
	- white matter is organized into tracts which myelinated axons of long interneurons with a similar function. 
	- **Ascending tracts** transmit information to the brain, while **descending tracts** transmit information from the brain to the body
- **grey matter** consists of efferent cell bodies, their dendries, short interneurons, glial cells, and afferent synaptic terminals 
	- **dorsal horn** houses synpatic terminals of afferent neurons. Houses interneuron cell bodies. 
	- ** lateral horn** is home to interneuron axons. Also has cell bodies of autonomic efferent neurons. 
	- **ventral horn** houses motor neuron efferent neuron cell bodies.

![[Pasted image 20210227183734.png]]

- **first order neuron:** afferent neurons to the spinal cord
- **second order neuron:** travel up ascending tracts and cross from one side of the body to the other **(dessucation)**. Terminated in the reticular formation (thalamus)
- **third order neurons:** are part of the reticular activating systems and travel from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex (somaesthetic cortex in the parietal lobe). 

![[Pasted image 20210227184049.png]]

##### Spinal Nerves

- connect with the spinal cord via a dorsal root and ventral root
- **dorsal root**: afferent
- **ventral root**: efferent
- **dorsal root ganglion** houses the cell bodies of afferent neurons. 
- dorsal and ventral roots join to form a spinal nerve 
- a **nerve** is a bundle of peripheral neuronal axons enclosed by a covering of connective tissue. There are no nerves in the CNS.
- Bundles of axons in the CNS are called tracts
- 31 spinal and 12 cranial nerves consitute the peripheral nervous system

A **dermatome** is an area of the body surface supplied by a particular spinal nerve. 


##### Basic Reflexes

A **reflex** is a response that occurs without concious effort. 

- **simple (basic) reflexes** are built in
- **aquired (conditioned) reflexes** are learned

##### Reflex Arc

1. Receptor
2. Afferent Pathway
3. Integrator
4. Efferent Pathway
5. Effector

##### Stretch Reflex

- **monosynaptic (vs polysynaptic):** afferent neuron synapses directly to efferent neuron
- originates in stretch receptor of muscle
- allows for optimal resting length to be maintained
- eg. patellar tendon reflex (actually there is a polysynaptic portion to this reflex, see picture below)
	- tapping the patellar tendon stretches the quadricepts muscle
	- stretch reflex brings about the contraction of this extensor muscle
- stretch reflex stops muscles from buckling under gravity

![[Pasted image 20210227184236.png]]

##### Withdrawl Reflex

- 6 neurons involved:
	- **afferent neuron** is connected to a receptor (eg. thermal receptor when you touch a hot stove). This neuron travels to the spinal cord where it diverges to 3 axon terminals
	- two of the axons terminals are attached to three **interneurons**, one of which travels in an ascending tract to the brain (**dessucation:** crossing the midline of the body). This sensory neuron will stimulate the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe, causing perception of the stimulus. 
	- The two interneurons are attached to two **efferent motor neurons**, one which causes EPSPs in the flexor muscle (eg. bicep) and one which causes IPSPs in the extensor muscle (eg. tricep) to cause the limb to withdraw
- **reciprocal innervation:** when the neurons to one muscle is excited and the neurons to the antagonist muscle is simultaneously inhibited.

![[Pasted image 20210301120209.png]]

##### Babinski Ankle Jerk Reflex

- big toe straightens and other toes fan outwards when stimulated by a sweaping pressure on the bottom of the foot
- this disappears when the child ages (> 2 years), if it doesn't it is a sign of neurological issues with the **corticospinal tract**. 

##### Crossed extensor reflex

- step on a tack: 
	- withdrawl reflex in on the injured side
	- **cross extensor reflex** stimulates the uninjured side to support the body weight
- 10 neurons involved:
	- afferent from injured foot
	- two interneurons and two motor neurons cause withdrawl reflex on injured side (+4)
	- one interneuron to brain (+1)
	- two interneurons and two motor neurons cause cross extensor reflex (+4)

Not all activity has a well defined reflex arc:
- some **responses are mediated by hormones.** 
- some **local responses do not involve nerves or hormones** (blood vessels dilating locally due to metabolic changes)

### 3.5 Brain Stem (109-112)

- beneath (inferior to) the occipital lobe and in front of (anterior to) the cerebellum. 
- Continuous with the spinal cord
- Consits of the 
	- **pons**
	- **medulla oblongata**
	- **midbrain**
- Functions:
	1.majority of the 12 cranial nerves aries from the brains stem. These nerves innervate the face (except nerve 10: **the vagus nerve** which innervates the visceral organs in the thoracic and abdominal cavities). Vagus nerve constitues 75% of all parasympathetic fibers. 
	2. There are **neuronal clusters** called **centers** that control heart and blood vessel function, repsiration and digestion. 
	3. regulates muscle reflexes involved in equillibrium and posture
	4. widespread network of interconnected neurons called the **reticular formation** runs through the brain stem and into the thalamus. This formation **receives and integrates all incoming sensory synaptic input**. Ascending fibers from the reticular formation arouse and active the cerebral cortex. These fibers make up the **reticular activating system** which controls cortical alertness and attention direction. Fibers descending from the cortex can in turn activate the RAS. 
	5. centers that control sleep have traditionally been considered to be housed in the brain stem (although we now know the thalamus plays a role as well).

### 3.6 Thalamus and Hypothalamus (112-113)

- form the **diencehalon** consists of the hypothalamus and thalamus and serves as the wall to the third ventricular cavity.

##### Thalamus

- relay station and integrating center for sensory input on its way to the cortex
- important for the ability to direct attention to important stimuli
- positively reinforces voluntary motor behavior initiated by the cortex

##### Hypothalamus

1. hunger and food intake
2. thirst and urination
3. sleep-wake cycle
4. emotions
5. body temperature
6. controls anterior pituitary hormone secretion
7. produces posterior pituitary hormones
8. controls uterine contraction and milk ejection
9. serves as major autonomic coordinating center (effecting smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and exocrine glands)
10. links the endocrine and nervous systems

### 3.7 Cerebral Cortex (113-121)

- two **cerebral hemispheres** are connected via the **corpus callosum** (~300 million neuronal axons)
- each hemisphere is made up of a thin outershell of **grey matter** (the cerebral cortex), covering internal **white matter**
- The **basal ganglia** is another region of grey matter located deep within the white matter. 
- **grey matter:** densely packaged cell bodies, dendrites and glial cells. 
- **white matter:** bundles (tracts) of myelinated axons 
- cortex is organized into **six well defined layers** based on cell types
- layers are organized into functional vertical columns that act as a team, each one being involved in some part of the same activity
- functional differences are a result of different layering patterns, not from unique cell types
	- eg. sense perception areas have an expanded area rich in **stellate cells** which process sensory information
	- eg. areas responsible for motor control to skeletal muscles have a thickend layer of **pyramidal cells** which send fibers down to the spinal cord to terminate of efferent motor neurons

##### Lobes in the Cerebral Cortex

###### Frontal

- dorsal portion (immediatly anterior to **central sulcus**) is the **primary motor cortex** which works inconjunction with the
	- **premotor cortex**
	- **supplementary motor area** (inner surface of cortex anterior to the premotor cortex)
	- **cerebellum**
	- **anterior paretal cortex** (processes sensory input nessecary for the premotor cortex to create the motor program)
- to plan and execute movements (develop  the **motor program**). The primary motor cortex itself does not initiate movements, it is merely the "puppet strings". It is activated by a neuronal discharge called the **readiness potential**. This is initated by the four helpers listed above. 
- Primary motor cortex contains large **pyramindal cell neurons**
- **premotor cortex** also works in conjunction with the basal ganglia to plan movements or actions, which are refined by the **cerebellum**
- the **motor homonculus** take a cross section of the motor cortex to depict the location and relative amount of the 	motor cortex devoted to the muscles in the body

![[Pasted image 20210227181018.png]]

###### Parietal Lobes

- house the **somaesthetic cortex** which deals with the perception of **somaesthetic senses**: coming from the surface of the body
- this cortex is immediatly posterior to the central sulcus
- this cortex also deals with **proproception**

##### Temporal lobes

- initial reception of sound  sensation

##### Occipital Lobes

- initial processing of visual input

![[Pasted image 20210227181332.png]]
tag: brain map

- A slice of the somaesthetic cortex can be taken to create the sensory homonculus

![[Pasted image 20210227181509.png]]

- thalamus -> simple awarness of sensation, somaesthetic cortex -> fuller sensory perception

##### Plasticity

- the brain has an ability to remodel based on the demands placed on it
- while highest in youth, the brain retains some plasticity into adulthood
- this is achieved through changes in dendridic shape that make new neural pathways


##### Electroencephalograms (EEGs)

- record the collective postsynaptic activity (EPSPs and IPSPs)
1. diagnosis of cerbral disfunction (eg. epilepsy)
2. legal determination of brain death
3. distinguish stages of sleep

##### Stroke

- cerebral blood vessel is blocked
- death of oxegen deprived tissue (necrosis)
- neighbours die by apoptosis
	- initially oxegen starved cells release glutamate
	- bind with NMDA receptors, which function as K+ channels
	- rise in intracellular K+ causes apoptosis

##### Lateralization of the brain

- **left**
	- language
	- analyitical and logical
	-  houses Wernicke (left temporal lobe) (speech understanding) and Broca's area (left frontal lobe) (speech production)
- **right**
	- creative and artistic
