		- company specific
		- future oriented
- **Financial accounting**
	- users:
		- investors

##### Buisness Organization

- **proprietorship:** single owner (unlimited liability)
- **partnership:** two owners (unlimited liability)
- **Corporation:** 
	- owned by shareholders
	- run by board of directors 
	- each shareholder has limited liability
	- corporations have many rights, like the right to sue and the right to own property

#####  GAAP
- provide useful accounting information
- revelent: to investors 
- reliable: reproducable across audits by different accountants
- comparable: to past audits and from buisness to buisness

##### Accounting Principles

1. **Entity Concept:** each entity is an economic unit and is kept seperate from other entities
2. **Relevance Characteristic:** provide timely feedback that allows for appropriate decision making 
3. **Reliabilty/Objectivity Principle:** accounting records should be based on accurate data. *There is a balance between obtaining information that is relevant (like making timely estimates, potentially being innaccurate) and accurate (that may require additional time to ensure accuracy, potentially rendering the information irrelevant).*
4. **Cost Principle:** assests and services should be recorded based on actual costs (as opposed to market values that can vary over time).
5. **Going-concern concept:** assumes that entity will remain in operation for the foreseeable future
6. **Stable Monetary Unit Concept:** ignore the effect of inflation. 

##### Accounting Language

- **Financial Statement:** financial information about a buisness entity that is prepared in a systematic report format that can be used by decision makers to make decisions
	- **income statement:** presents the companies sales and expenses over a period of time (rate: units of dollars per year or dollars per quarter)
	- **balance sheet:** snapshot summary of companies financial accounts (units in dollars)
	- **statement of cash flow:** can be derived from balance sheets at the begninng and end of period and the income statment during a period. 
	- **statement of retained earnings:** aka an equity statement, a financial document that includes information about retained earning, net income, and amount distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.

##### Balance Sheet and Income Statment

![[Pasted image 20210228160610.png]]

##### Accounting equation

- **assests = liabilities + equity**
- **assests:** allow the company to make money
- assests are financed (payed for) through **liabilities** - debts the company has to certain stakeholders - and **equity** - money payed in through shareholders and money retained from previous earnings. 

##### 5 main accounts

###### Balance Sheet

1. **Assets **
	- short term assests
	- long term assests
2. **Liabilities**
	- short term liabilities
	- long term liabilties
3. **Equity**
	- paid in equity
	- retained earnings
- permanent accounts: not "closed out"

###### Income Statement
 
 - **net income** = revenues - expenses
 4. ** expenses:** costs incurred
 5. **revenues:** sales collected
 - these accounts are temporary because they are "closed out" at the end of a period. Resets income statment and transfers value of net income onto balance sheet and the **retained earning account ** (an account within the equity account)

##### The Account

- **account:** main summary device for the recording of changes
- **permanent accounts** are those found on the balance sheet:
	1. **Assets:** economic resources that benefit the buisness now and in the future.
		- **short term current assets:**
			- cash: money the buisness has on hand (in bank accounts)
			- accounts receivable: money that is owed to the company by its customers for sales that have been made but not collected
			- inventory: unfinished and finished materials that the company sells
			- notes receivable: short term loans the company issued to stakeholders
			- prepaid expenses: expenses the company has already paid for but not yet used
		- **long term expenses:** land, building, equipment, furniture, and fixtures
	2. **Liabilities:** debts of the company
		- **Current liabilities:** those that are due within a year
			- bank loans
			- notes payable: debts the company owes to certain stakeholders
			- accounts payable: expenses inccured but not yet paid for
		- **Long term liabilties:** debts that are due further than on year.
			- long term bank loans
			- bonds
			- mortgages
	3. **Shareholders (owners) equity:** the owner's claims to the assets of a corporation
		- **contributed captial: ** historical amount of money invested into the company
		- **retained earnings:** increases by (revenues - expenses)


##### Transactions 

- any event that has a financial impact on the buisness
	- can be measured reliably
	- provide objective information
	- must be able to assign a $ value to the event

##### The Basis: Accrual or Cash

- *transactions are to be recorded when they occur, not when the cash is actually exchanged*
- this is known as **accrual accounting**
	- this means you may pay tax on moneys you have yet to recieve
	- you can claim expenses you have not paid for yet
- if *cash is used as the time to recognize a transaction, then we have **cash basis** accounting*
	- the former is used in almost all buisnesses
	- the latter is usefull for small bash based buisness

##### Double-Entry Accounting 

- uses **debits** and **credits** for each transaction

##### The T-Account

![[Pasted image 20210228163052.png]]

- **left hand side:** assests
- **right hand side:** liabilities and shareholders equity. 
- some account are considered **left hand side accounts**, where increaes in value are recorded on the left hand side. Others are considered **right hand accounts**.
- In double entry accounting **debits are left hand operations**, credits are **right hand operations**

![[Pasted image 20210228163302.png]]

- a debit on the left hand side account increases its value
- a credit on a right hand side account increases its value

![[Pasted image 20210228163552.png]]

- in the above example:
	- increase in cash: debit cash account
	- increase in common shares: credit common shares account

- **revenues are a right hand side account** because an increase in revenues increaes retained earnings
- **expenses are a left hand side account** because an increase in expenses decreases retained earnings

### Tara Inc Example

##### To generate income statment and balance sheet

- find balance for each account (debits - credits for left hand accounts, credits - debits for right hand side accounts)
- **close out** expenses and revenues to retained earnings.
	- **credit each expense account its balance, and debit retained earnings the same amount**
	- **debit revenues account its balance, and credit retained earnings the same ammount**
	- **find balance of retained earnings account**
