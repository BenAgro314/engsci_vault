**State your research interests and how the proposed experience will complement your current program of studies, as well as your personal, academic, or professional goals. Required to answer. (<= 250 words, this text is 34)**


**Current research interests**

- my passion lies in 
	- application of novel algorithms and computational techniques to solve problems in robotics
	- simulation of dynamical systems and the transfer of those simulations to reality
	- application of robotics solutions to real world problems (this requires life-long-learning and adaptability to new environments)

**Complementing current program of study**

- taking robotics major next semeseter
- good preperation for my course content
	- Data Structures and Analysis
	- point sparse Gaussian process

**Complementing personal, academic, or proffesional goals**

- point sparse Gaussian process
- making novel contributions to the field of robotics is both an academic and personal goal
- opporotunity to write an academic paper and submit it to a conference
- personal goal to learn more about the fundamental theory underpinning machine learning and neural networks
