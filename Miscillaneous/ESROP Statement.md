My primary research interests lie in:

1. The application of novel algorithms to solve problems in robotics.
2. The simulation of dynamic systems and bridging the sim-to-real gap. (comparing the performance of a robot in simulation to the real world).
3. Creating generally applicable robots that can solve a wide range of real-world problems in complex environments.

The proposed research experience would compliment all three of these interests. The project works to develop novel reinforcement learning methods that are more computationally tractable and exhibit forward and backward transfer of learned skills. With these traits, a learning model, and the robot it is applied to, would be more scalable and adaptable. In working on this project, I will have the opportunity to develop more generally proficient robotic systems. This generality will allow robots to tackle real-world problems. 

Moving into the latter half of the Engineering Science program, I plan to take the robotics major. Therefore, this summer research work will motivate my academic studies. This will cultivate the optimal academic environment, as I am most motivated to learn when I see the direct application of theory to a project. 

This project will also support some of my personal goals. I will have the opportunity to write and submit an academic paper to a conference, developing academic writing and professional skills that will be important for future research. I will also be able to participate in reading groups and seminars, broadening my academic and social network for future collaboration.
