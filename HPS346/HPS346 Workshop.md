- **Review the example: what is its purpose and what does it achieve?  **
	- cleaning up the oceans
	- microsurgery
- **What is the most desirable quality (or the considerations) that encouraged the experiment to happen?**
	- small
	- healing
	- scalable
	- extremely efficient booster shot
	- encoding more complex goals?
- connection between the two examples is **modularity**
	- about constructing the life
- understanding and control by building from the ground up
- **how do we define the notion of "programming the body"? and why should we do so**
	- genetic programming
	- 
- **what are the ethical implications of this?**
	- inequality (if left up to the market)
	- imposing changes on your germline without their choice?
	- disability vs enhancment, where is the line?
	- [George Church](http://arep.med.harvard.edu/gmc/)
	- what about environmental factors in the consideration of genetic modification? Nature vs nurture debate?

**modular body:**
- human body is outdated (kind of dangerous narrative)
- interesting how the Xenobots followed the science fiction narrative
- how about replacement organs, do these not count as **modular bodies**


**Scalable Pipeline Paper**
- why are the methods in the scalable pipeline paper very not scalable
- maybe it's worthwhile to read the opposition to heart transplants when they were first introduced many decades ago
- why do we call them robots? are they not living organisms
- also there are some very conflicting ideologies in paper, since they want very fine control over the distribution of cells and structure of the organism, but they also want spontaneous and complex events (like self repair), that occur due to both the self contained nature of cells (which is fine), but also the structure of the organism (which kinda defeats the purpose of their style of design)
- allowing these organisms to reproduce?
- DARPA and military capacity. Or are they just their to controll risks?
- Doesn't DARPA sometimes get involved in things to evaluate risks and develop countermeasures too, though? I'm not saying the shadow of military applications isn't there, just that DARPA-involvement doesn't necessarily mean plans to deploy something in a military capacity
- is this really new/novel? New life is not being created?

**Keywords and themes**
- power 
- control
- modularity
- **efficiency** <- buiani's big word
