In his seminal 1947 essay, Edward Bernays described Engineerng of Consent (EOC) as the “use of
an engineering approach—that is, action based only on thorough knowledge of the situation and on
the application of scientific principles and tried practices to the task of getting people to support
ideas and programs” [1]. In other words, EOC is the use of scientific and data-driven methods
to instill a preference within a population. Any political or commercial organization “depends
ultimately on public approval, and is therefore faced with the problem of engineering the public’s
consent to a program or goal” [1]. In the information age, EOC has become increasingly relevant
to both political and commercial campaigns [2]. The integration of the internet into every aspect
of our lives has given rise to computational politics: the application of “computational methods to
large datasets derived from online and offline data sources for conducting outreach, persuasion and
mobilization in the service of electing, furthering or opposing a candidate, a policy or legislation”
[2].
This paper will examine the role genomics - the study of genes and their functions1 - will play in
the future of EOC for both state and commercial actors [3]. We argue that three trends will make
genomic data a powerful tool in the future of EOC. Specifically, genomic data is becoming more
prevalent and accessible, it is a powerful inferential tool for psychological traits and predispositions,
and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) will allow for the synthesis of predictive models of the
individual based on a heterogeneous network of data. We conclude with a discussion on the potential
consequences and risks of these developments. As explained by Bernays, “the engineering of consent
should be based theoretically and practically on the complete understanding of those whom it
attempts to win over” (emphasis added), and a genome is a potent datum for understanding the
individual[1] [3].

Trends in genomics
Volume, scope and accessibility
Contemporary EOC techniques rely on big data to design and target informational campaigns. The
volume, scope, and accessibility of genomic data have been increasing at an exponential rate since
the start of the 21st century, increasing the likely-hood of genomically-informed EOC. There are
two main types of organizations that gather genomic data: governments and companies.
Governments: Across the world, population surveillance using genomic data is becoming increasingly prevalent. For example, the Chinese government is compiling the largest DNA database
in the world, “yet, unlike the managers of other forensic databases, Chinese authorities are deliberately enrolling tens of millions of people who have no history of serious criminal activity” [4].
Even more concerning is the compulsory collection of DNA samples from children (Figure 1), which
violates the UN’s Convention on the Rights of the Child [4]. It is important to note that “to deploy
DNA surveillance across a group of people, you need profiles from only 2–5% of that population,
because biological relationships can be inferred” [5]. Thus, while the effectiveness of EOC will
depend on the amount of genomic data available, a campaign could target many people without
directly requiring their DNA.

Fujian provinces of China in 2019 [4].
China is not alone in this pursuit; other nations are building population-wide genomic databases
[6]. In 2015, Kuwait passed legislation authorizing the compulsory DNA collection from all residents
and citizens [6].
Companies: Commercial genomic databases are growing rapidly. By 2019, twenty six million
consumers sent their DNA for testing (see Figure 2). Simultaneously, detailed sequencing of the
genome is becoming increasingly affordable. As shown in Figure 2, the cost of genome sequencing
is decreasing at a rate exceeding “Moore’s law” (a halving of costs every two years).

Figure 2. Left: The total number of DNA tests by leading consumer genetic companies [7]. Right:
The cost to sequence one million DNA bases per year (with a logarithmic y-axis). To illustrate
the rate of cost reduction, the data are plotted alongside Moore’s law: a halving of costs every two
years [8].

Inferential and predictive power
The power of genomic data lies in its ability to make inferences about individuals and populations, and to predict how they will respond to EOC messaging. Apart from predisposition to
disease, genomics also provides insight into psychological traits and ethnicity, crucial information
for predicting and manipulating public opinion.
Personality, politics and interests: The totality of evidence suggests that individual variation in psychological traits are “substantively influenced by genetic factors” [9]. Currently, we
cannot determine which specific polymorphisms (genetic variations) correlate with complex traits
[10]. However, as discussed below, AI-enabled analysis is beginning to unlock the inferential power
of the genome.
Table 1 summarizes the estimated degree of heritability of various traits. Although Intelligence
Quotient (IQ) is a highly criticized metric biased against some minority groups, it is a strong predictor of education, occupational status, and health according to widely held views in quantitative
psychology [11]. It is also largely genetically determined [9]. Thus, whether or not it is a fair metric,
future EOC campaigns will use IQ if science can determine its correlations with genetic markers.
Pertinent to EOC, political ideologies are influenced by personality, and in turn, genetics [12].
As explained by Jonathan Haidt, “genes make brains, which come pre-wired with personality traits;
traits lead children to take different life paths, and these different paths lead us to construct life
narratives that fit a non-random subset of the available political ideologies” [11]. The genetic determination of some broad political ideologies, such as conservatism and right-wing authoritarianism,
has been measured and is presented in Table 1.



Table 1. Estimates of the degree of genetic determination (heritability) of various psychological
metrics2 [9]. Unless otherwise listed, all data are for adults over the age of 20. The scale ranges
from zero to one, with zero meaning genetics plays no role, and one meaning the trait is entirely
genetically determined.
Race, Ethnicity, and Genealogy: Race is a socially constructed category of observable phenotypic differences (such as skin color) between groups assumed to have different biogeographical
ancestries or genetic makeup [13]. Ethnicity is a complex construct reflecting biological factors, geographical origins, historical influences, and shared customs [13]. These categorizations are mainly
social, not genetic. This is typified in the historical use of the “one-drop rule”, which states that an
individual with any degree of African ancestry would be considered a member of the Black race [13].
Nevertheless, genomic data can infer race and ethnicity by determining lineage [14]. This paper
will not discuss the correlation (or lack thereof) between preferences and genetically determined
race and ethnicity. We want to highlight that genomic data can make these socially important
categorizations.
Determining genealogy, or a family tree, is perhaps the most established branch of genomics [14].
With the increasing prevalence of data, inference of genealogy will play an important role in the
future of EOC. A population-level family tree will allow targeted messaging based on the actions,
characteristics, and predispositions of relatives. Consider data about the political preferences and
voting turnout of one’s parents. A child’s political ideology correlates highly with that of their
parents [15]. In conjunction with genealogical information, political campaigns would have fine4

grained detail informing the creation and targeting their messages (e.g. those with a high likelihood
of turnout or people “on the fence”), effectively grooming the next generation of voters.

Data Diversity and AI enabled analysis
As aforementioned, while many psychological metrics are partially genetically determined, given a
genome, we cannot yet make actual predictions about these traits and thus cannot use genomics
for EOC. The challenge lies in the fact that “genetic influences on complex traits will be composed
of thousands of markers of very small effects and it will require extremely large samples to have
enough power to identify specific polymorphisms related to complex social traits” (emphasis added)
[10]. Solutions to this problem are rapidly approaching due to the production of large amounts of
genomic data, the diverse personal information generated through our online interactions, and the
ability for novel computational methods in the field of deep learning to find correlations in large
datasets.
Multimodal personalized data: Genomic data need to be labelled with the attributes of the
people it represents to draw correlations between genetic and psychological traits. Using machine
learning algorithms, the data left behind in our online footprints will provide the labels necessary to
determine these correlations. While some of the data we upload to the internet is self-evident, Tufeki
describes how we also leave behind a layer of latent data [2]. Latent data include our geographic
location, financial transactions, subscriptions, affiliations, conversations, and even individual mouse
clicks, which “lends itself to deeper and direct insight into a person’s opinions, dispositions and
behaviors” [2].
AI analysis: Recent developments in artificial intelligence are the final piece of the puzzle
enabling the engineering of consent with genomic data. Deep learning (DL) is a machine learning
method that is highly effective with large data sets [16]. Much research is being conducted on
the application of DL to genomics [16]. Based on recent work “it is evident that DL models can
provide higher accuracies in specific tasks of genomics than the state-of-the-art methodologies. In
addition, deep learning has the ability to deal with multimodal data effectively” (emphasis added)
[16]. The affordances of AI are not limited to the inference of traits based on genomic data. AI
can generate accurate predictions of future responses to political and commercial campaigns. Much
work in this area has already been conducted. For example, using big-data, the Obama campaign
was “able to go deep into Republican territory, to individually pick voters that they had modeled as
likely Democrats within otherwise Republican suburbs, breaking the lock of the precinct at voter
targeting” (emphasis added) [2].
Companies are already extracting value from this intersection of multimodal data and AIenabled analysis. ICarbonX is a billion-dollar Shenzhen company developing software to detect
patterns between individuals genomic, medical, and digital data [17].

Consequences and risks
Just as the digital age brought about a computational revolution in the engineering of consent
[2], the trends in genomics will allow organizations to control public opinion. We present three
potential consequences of this development and their associated risks.
Enhanced Microtargeting: Microtargeting is when a campaign, political or commercial,
tailors its messaging to ensure that each citizen is served a message they will find palatable [18].
Microtargeting enables more efficient and effective messaging by directing relevant campaign messages to potential supporters while avoiding staunch opposition and ardent supporters. Leveraging
genomic and trace online data, algorithms will construct detailed models of the individual, enhancing microtargeting accuracy. In 2004, privacy expert for the Clinton administration summed up
fears about microtargeting:
“The nightmare scenario is that the databases create puppet masters [. . . ] Every voter
will get a tailored message based on detailed information about the voter. [This] means
that the public debates lack content and the real election happens in the privacy of
these mailings. The candidate knows everything about the voter, but the media and
the public know nothing about what the candidate really believes. It is, in effect, a
nearly perfect perversion of the political process” [18]
Wedge issues are contentious topics that are highly likely to mobilize voters or customers [2].
While generally avoided in the public forum, microtargeting leverages wedge issues. Campaigns
can make selective promises based on the predicted preferences of each individual. Genomics adds
a new level of fidelity to the deployment of wedge issues and risks increasing political polarization.
For instance, one could imagine a political campaign using genomically predicted medical predispositions to promise different health care systems to different people. The application of genomics
to microtargeting will exacerbate these issues, resulting in further polarization of the public.
Information Asymmetry: High-quality genomic data will be an extremely valuable resource
due to its inferential and predictive capacity. Thus, power will be concentrated in the hands of
those that control the genomic data.
State actors could use their genomic data to instill conformity in their population, supplementing
genomics with offline surveillance. With an estimated 626 million surveillance cameras equipped
with facial recognition capabilities, China can cross-reference surveillance footage, digital footprints,
and genomic data to understand every facet of their population [19]. This parallels Foucault’s
concept of biopower; genomics, surveillance, and EOC are being used as control techniques to
produce loyal citizens [20] [21].
The commercial genomics industry is subject to network effects: those with the most data
provide the best service, so their patronage and datasets will increase further [22]. This positive
feedback loop could establish the leading commercial gene banks as an oligopoly, similar to the
technology giants of today [22]. As is characteristic of personal data, once it is bestowed to a company, the individual loses all control. For example, the terms of service of GEDmatch, a genomics
6

service with over a million profiles, says that users must “understand that future genealogical and
non-genealogical uses may be developed, including uses that GEDmatch cannot predict or foresee”
[23]. Economic incentives will drive companies to use their genomic data for auxiliary purposes:
selling it to the highest bidder or for use in microtargeted advertising.
Systemic Discrimination: Genomic data will allow for the identification of current societal
categories (e.g. race), and the delineation based on previously invisible attributes such as genealogy,
predispositions, and personality. Genomically-informed EOC risks exacerbating current inequalities
and the creation of new means for systemic discrimination.
Microtargeting has the potential to alienate groups of people from the political process [18].
Campaigns will invest less resources to target people predicted to be unlikely to vote. The ignored
groups will be less likely to vote in the subsequent election, compounding their political apathy [18].
Genetic traits that correlate negatively with turnout likelihood will be selected against in the microtargeting process, calcifying systemic disparities in political participation. Likely, these correlations
are not the result of intrinsic genetic factors, but a preexisting history of marginalization.

Conclusion
The engineering of consent is both “the very essence of the democratic process” yet it “can be
subverted; demagogues can utilize the techniques for anti-democratic purposes with as much success
as can those who employ them for socially desirable ends” [1]. Here we have argued that the
trends in genomics - increasing volume of multimodal data, inferential and predictive power, and
AI-enabled analysis - provide a degree of power beyond which any campaign would need in a
fair democracy or sustainable economy. This poses risks to personal privacy, political discourse,
and societal equity. While these dynamics are rapidly approaching, corrective intervention is still
possible. However, those doing the regulating, namely the government, are incentivized to increase
their EOC capabilities to ensure re-election. The solution lies with two actors: individuals and
scientists.
Individual in countries where genomic data are still under personal control be very wary about
providing genetic material to any governmental or commercial organization. In this respect, public
education about the risks - similar to what we see with the recent wave of social media backlash
[24] - is crucial.
The technologies and scientific knowledge allowing genomics to be used for EOC (AI, genomic
correlations with traits) are not yet ready but are under rapid development. Thus, control lies in
the hands of research scientists and engineers. They need to recognize that their work will have
real societal consequences. As Fourneret explains “we are quite right to ask again and again for a
significant recruitment of philosophers, anthropologists, and sociologists by scientific laboratories”
to ensure ethical development and deployment of genomic technologies [25].
