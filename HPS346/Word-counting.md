Introduction

Advances in synthetic biology and artificial intelligence are spearheading innovation in the 21**
century. This workshop sought to explore and discuss two media - a scientific paper and science-
fiction film - related to these technological advances. This report will summarize the workshop
content and course connections, explore a crucial question raised during the discussion, and provide

an annotated bibliography for future research.

Summary

Content

The workshop discussion was motivated by two pieces of media.

The first is an academic paper titled “A scalable pipeline for designing reconfigurable organ-
isms.” [|]. This paper presents a method that “designs completely biclogical machines from the
ground up: computers automatically design new machines in simulation, and the best designs are
then built by combining different biological tissues.” These biological machines are called Xenobots
after the frog species Xenopus laevis, from which the “building-block” stem cells were harvested.
The Xenobots are capable of four different actions: locomotion, object manipulation, object trans-
port, and collective behavior.

The second is a online science-fiction film called “The Modular Body” |]. Through a non-
sequential series of short videos, the story follows Cornelis Vlasman, an innovative biologist trying
to create OSCAR: the world’s first living organism. OSCAR is a prototype of a modular human
featuring “clickable” organ modules grown from human tissue configurable into a variety of mor-
phologies. The videos vary widely in their content, including lab footage, news discussion boards,

vlogs, and promotional material.
Course Connections

Below we explore a few of the many course themes touched on throughout the workshop.

Both pieces of media could be seen as products and propagators of the DIY bio movement
[|]. While the research originates in an established university, the methodology for developing
Xenobots is fully open-source. The accompanying website includes the necessary code, biological
material sources, and instructions for constructing the Xenobots [.], promoting the notion that
anyone should be able to replicate their research. In The Modular Body, OSCAR’s development
team is framed as a group of “biohackers” working out of an independent lab. Their work is headed
by a visionary entrepreneur unconstrained by any institutional oversight and thus able to push the
technological and ethical boundaries of synthetic biology.

There are parallels between Vlasman and Frankenstein. We can examine The Modular Body
through Davies’s insights on the ethical concerns raised in Frankenstein [|]. Highlighting just

three points relevant to this story:

1. Scientific experimentation can harm [ ||. We must consider both the subject and the exper-
imenter. Vlasman, is seduced by the potential for immortality presented by his research, a

victim of hubris and opportunity.

2. The character of the researcher matters [|]. This is especially true with scientific power

concentrated in the power of a few people, as it is in Vlasman and his lab partners.

3. Scientific protocols require scrutiny and close adherence [ |], contrasting Vlasman’s rene-
gade, DIY bio attitude. Novel biological research also strays into unknown ethical territory,

warranting the establishment of agreed-upon protocols.

A Key Question and Discussion

Here, we will examine one of the questions raised during the workshop discussion:

How do we define the notion of “programming the body” and why is it

important to do so?

We argue that there are two categories of “programming the body”: genetic programming and
morphological programming.

Genetic programming is the emerging practice of altering the genome of an organism during its
embryonic development to elicit desired phenotypic changes [| |. In this sense, the “source code” for
life (the genome) is being “programmed”. The vanguard technology in this field is CRISPR-Cas9
[ |.

However, we must recognize the limitations of the term “programming” in this context. As
many scholars have highlighted, current genome editing technologies are inaccurate. Eben Kirksey

describes CRISPR-Cas9 as less of an editing tool than a predator drone with a tactile missile [].
There is a risk of collateral damage to off-target nucleotides, contrasting the notion of programming
in its conventional setting [ ] where editing source code is a matter of precisely changing letters
through a computer terminal. Even with modern debugging tools, consequential programming
errors plague commercial products [ |. Thus, how can we expect to make non-trivial edits using
CRISPR-Cas9 without devastating mistakes?

Morphological programming refers to encoding the functions and behaviors of an organism (or
robot) in the physical features of its body. The Xenobots are a prime example of this. Their
morphology was “programmed” (designed) by an evolutionary algorithm to elicit certain behaviors,
circumventing the need for a nervous system [|]. Whereas computer programming acts on software,
morphological programming acts on the structural features of life. This idea is present in The
Modular Body; the advantages of a modular body system come from its morphological differences
to a closed system [ ].

While both genetic and morphological programming aim to obtain phenotypic changes, they
present unique research challenges and ethical questions. Gene editing poses complications for
society through the potential for human alteration and designer babies [|]. On the other hand,
morphological programming could allow for the synthesis of novel biological robots [ ][)]. As
scholars have highlighted, these biological robots could do good (cleaning plastics from the ocean,

microsurgery) or great harm (biological weapons) [ [|].

It reviews examples of experimental biology that make us question our understanding
of life, death and self. The author poses that biological robots are an opportunity to

understand the origin and capacities of cognition.
