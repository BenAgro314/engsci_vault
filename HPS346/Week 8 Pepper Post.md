Are Xenobots Robots? A Reflection on Substrate Neutrality 

Back in week 3 (info-bio), there was a brief discussion on the topic of **substrate neutrality** as put forth by Daniel Dennet in his book [Darwin's Dangerous Idea](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/lehre/pmo/eng/Dennett-Darwin%27sDangerousIdea.pdf). Dennet poses substrate neutrality as a core trait of any algorithm:

 > "*substrate neutrality:* The procedure for long division works equally well with pencil or pen, paper or parchment, neon lights, or skywriting, using any symbol system you like. The power of the procedure is due to its logical structure, not the causal powers of the materials used in the instantiation, just so long as those causal powers permit the prescribed steps to be followed exactly" (Dennet, 50-51)

Dennet also claims that natural selection is simply an amalgamation of algorithms. The natural selection that Darwin originally discovered is simply running on the substrate of living systems. 

I think that the Xenobots and the in-silico evolutionary process used to create them support this idea. Evolutionary algorithms run in-silico have been shown to be transferable to in-vivo environments, representing a convergence between the "traditional" evolutionary processes that take place on living systems and evolutionary processes that run on a computer.

That being said **what are the implications of substrate neutrality on our notion of life itself?** Do we separate the living and non-living by their substrate or the "algorithms" that they are running? Can life processes, even the very complex ones, be viewed as algorithms? 

This naturally leads us to question both the "living" and "robot" status of Xenobots. While their substrate (frog cells) are classified as living, are the Xenobots themselves alive?

I would love to hear the classes' thoughts on some of the big questions outlined above!
