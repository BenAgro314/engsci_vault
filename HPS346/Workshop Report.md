### Introduction

Novel advances in synthetic biology and artificial intelligence are spearheading technological innovation in the 21st century. This workshop sought to explore and discuss two media - a scientific paper and science-fiction film - related to these technological advances. This report will summarize the content and its course connections and explore the crucial questions raised during the discussion, including an annotated bibliography containing sources for future research.

### Summary

#### Content

This workshop consisted of discussion and debate motivated by two pieces of media. 

The first is an academic paper by Kreigerman et al. titled *"A scalable pipeline for designing reconfigurable organisms.* (Kreigerman). This paper presents a method that "designs completely biological machines from the ground up: computers automatically design new machines in simulation, and the best designs are then built by combining different biological tissues." These biological machines are called Xenobots after the frog species Xenopus laevis, from which the necessary embryonic stem cells were harvested. The Xenobots are designed *in-silico* using evolutionary algorithms and implemented and test *in-vivo* for four different actions: locomotion, object manipulation, object transport, and collective behavior. 

The second is an online science-fiction film titled *"The Modular Body"*. The story consists a series of short videos that one can navigate in any order. It follows a team of "biohackers" headed by an innovative biologist trying to create the world's first living organism OSCAR. OSCAR is a prototype of a modular human. It features "clickable" organ modules grown from human tissue that are configurable into a variety of morphologies. The videos vary widely in their content, including lab footage, news discussion boards, youtube vlogs, and promotional material for OSCAR. 
#### Course Connections 

### Key Questions and Discussion

Throughout the workshop discussion, many important and provacative questions were raised. Here, we will examine two of these questions, and pose some related areas for future research.

The first question is **what are the current and future ethical implications of the Xenobot and (hyporthetically) modular body technologies?** This question is important because it probe the societal consequences these technologies could have once adopted (postman). Thus, the answers to this question will direct further technological development and regulatory protocols.
