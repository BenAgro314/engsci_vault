### Introduction

Novel advances in synthetic biology and artificial intelligence are spearheading technological innovation in the 21st century. This workshop sought to explore and discuss two media - a scientific paper and science-fiction film - related to these technological advances. This report will summarize the content and its course connections and explore the crucial questions raised during the discussion, including an annotated bibliography containing sources for future research.

### Summary

#### Content

This workshop consisted of discussion and debate motivated by two pieces of media. 

The first is an academic paper by Kreigerman et al. titled *"A scalable pipeline for designing reconfigurable organisms.* (Kreigerman). This paper presents a method that "designs completely biological machines from the ground up: computers automatically design new machines in simulation, and the best designs are then built by combining different biological tissues." These biological machines are called Xenobots after the frog species Xenopus laevis, from which the necessary embryonic stem cells were harvested. The Xenobots are designed *in-silico* using evolutionary algorithms and implemented and test *in-vivo* for four different actions: locomotion, object manipulation, object transport, and collective behavior. 

The second is an online science-fiction film called *"The Modular Body"*. The story consists of a series of short videos presented in a collage-like display, where the viewer can choose to navigate through the videos in any order they choose. It follows Cornelis Vlasman, an innovative biologist trying to create OSCAR, the world's first living organism. OSCAR is a prototype of a modular human featuring "clickable" organ modules grown from human tissue configurable into a variety of morphologies. The videos vary widely in their content, including lab footage, news discussion boards, youtube vlogs, and promotional material for OSCAR.

#### Course Connections 

These pieces connect to many of the key topics and themes discussed throughout the course, a few of which we explore below. 

Both could be seen as products and propagators of the DIY bio movement as outlined by Giordano. While the research originates in an established university, the methodology for developing Xenobots is fully open-source. The accompanying website includes the necessary code, biological material sources, and instructions for constructing the Xenobots. In "*The Modular Body*", OSCAR's development team is framed as a group of "*biohackers*" working out of an independent lab. Their work is headed by a visionary entrepreneur unconstrained by any institutional oversight and thus able to push the technological and ethical boundaries of synthetic biology. 

There are clear parallels between the work of Vlasman and that of Frankenstein. We can examine "*The Modular Body*" through H. Davies's insights on the ethical concerns raised in Frankenstein. Highlighting just three points relevant to this story:
1. Scientific experimentation can harm. We must consider both the subject and the experimenter. Vlasman, like Frankenstein, is seduced by the potential for immortality presented by his research, a victim of hubris and opportunity. 
2. The character of the researcher matters. This is especially true with scientific power concentrated in the power of a few people, as it is in Vlasman and his lab partners. 
3. Scientific protocols require scrutiny and close adherence, contrasting Vlasman's renegade, DIY bio, attitude. Novel biological research also strays into unknown ethical territory, so perhaps it should be postponed until the establishment of agreed-upon protocols.  
While there is no evidence that the Xenobot research suffers from these issues, their work will undoubtedly spawn replications and advancements in this field which will mandate the type of ethical scrutiny described by Davies. 

Vlasman is also reminiscent of Dr. He Jiankui as described by Kirksey. They are entrepreneurial scientists that step over ethical boundaries through their research. Their work is dangerous for both their subjects and society at large. However, while OSCAR gained mainstream acceptance, Dr. He was panned by the scientific community. This leads us to ask "*when and how synthetic biology will become a widespread medical intervention?*"

### Key Questions and Discussion

Throughout the workshop discussion, many important and provacative questions were raised. Here, we will examine two of these questions, and pose some related areas for future research.

The first question is **what are the current and future ethical implications of the Xenobot and (hyporthetically) modular body technologies?** This question is important because it probe the societal consequences these technologies could have once adopted (postman). Thus, the answers to this question will direct further technological development and regulatory protocols.
