# Week 8: Accounting Principles 

### Introduction

##### Purpose of Accounting

- measure buisness activity
- financial reporting
	- government (taxes, regulations)
	- internal decision making
	- investors

##### Types
- **managerial accounting**
	- users:
		- managers 
		- controllers
	- presentation:
		- company specific
		- future oriented
- **Financial accounting**
	- users:
		- investors 
		- government
	- presentation:
		- follows GAAP: generally accepted accounting principles

##### Buisness Organization

- **proprietorship:** single owner (unlimited liability)
- **partnership:** two owners (unlimited liability)
- **Corporation:** 
	- owned by shareholders
	- run by board of directors 
	- each shareholder has limited liability
	- corporations have many rights, like the right to sue and the right to own property

#####  GAAP
- provide useful accounting information
- revelent: to investors 
- reliable: reproducable across audits by different accountants
- comparable: to past audits and from buisness to buisness

##### Accounting Principles

1. **Entity Concept:** each entity is an economic unit and is kept seperate from other entities
2. **Relevance Characteristic:** provide timely feedback that allows for appropriate decision making 
3. **Reliabilty/Objectivity Principle:** accounting records should be based on accurate data. *There is a balance between obtaining information that is relevant (like making timely estimates, potentially being innaccurate) and accurate (that may require additional time to ensure accuracy, potentially rendering the information irrelevant).*
4. **Cost Principle:** assests and services should be recorded based on actual costs (as opposed to market values that can vary over time).
5. **Going-concern concept:** assumes that entity will remain in operation for the foreseeable future
6. **Stable Monetary Unit Concept:** ignore the effect of inflation. 

##### Accounting Language

- **Financial Statement:** financial information about a buisness entity that is prepared in a systematic report format that can be used by decision makers to make decisions
	- **income statement:** presents the companies sales and expenses over a period of time (rate: units of dollars per year or dollars per quarter)
	- **balance sheet:** snapshot summary of companies financial accounts (units in dollars)
	- **statement of cash flow:** can be derived from balance sheets at the begninng and end of period and the income statment during a period. 
	- **statement of retained earnings:** aka an equity statement, a financial document that includes information about retained earning, net income, and amount distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.

##### Balance Sheet and Income Statment

![[Pasted image 20210228160610.png]]

##### Accounting equation

- **assests = liabilities + equity**
- **assests:** allow the company to make money
- assests are financed (payed for) through **liabilities** - debts the company has to certain stakeholders - and **equity** - money payed in through shareholders and money retained from previous earnings. 

##### 5 main accounts

###### Balance Sheet

1. **Assets **
	- short term assests
	- long term assests
2. **Liabilities**
	- short term liabilities
	- long term liabilties
3. **Equity**
	- paid in equity
	- retained earnings
- permanent accounts: not "closed out"

###### Income Statement
 
 - **net income** = revenues - expenses
 4. ** expenses:** costs incurred
 5. **revenues:** sales collected
 - these accounts are temporary because they are "closed out" at the end of a period. Resets income statment and transfers value of net income onto balance sheet and the **retained earning account ** (an account within the equity account)

##### components of retained earnings

##### The Account

- **account:** main summary device for the recording of changes
- **permanent accounts** are those found on the balance sheet:
	1. **Assets:** economic resources that benefit the buisness now and in the future.
		- **short term current assets:**
			- cash: money the buisness has on hand (in bank accounts)
			- accounts receivable: money that is owed to the company by its customers for sales that have been made but not collected
			- inventory: unfinished and finished materials that the company sells
			- notes receivable: short term loans the company issued to stakeholders
			- prepaid expenses: expenses the company has already paid for but not yet used
		- **long term expenses:** land, building, equipment, furniture, and fixtures
	2. **Liabilities:** debts of the company
		- **Current liabilities:** those that are due within a year
			- bank loans
			- notes payable: debts the company owes to certain stakeholders
			- accounts payable: expenses inccured but not yet paid for
		- **Long term liabilties:** debts that are due further than on year.
			- long term bank loans
			- bonds
			- mortgages
	3. **Shareholders (owners) equity:** the owner's claims to the assets of a corporation
		- **contributed captial: ** historical amount of money invested into the company
		- **retained earnings:** increases by (revenues - expenses)


##### Transactions 

- any event that has a financial impact on the buisness
	- can be measured reliably
	- provide objective information
	- must be able to assign a $ value to the event

##### The Basis: Accrual or Cash

- *transactions are to be recorded when they occur, not when the cash is actually exchanged*
- this is known as **accrual accounting**
	- this means you may pay tax on moneys you have yet to recieve
	- you can claim expenses you have not paid for yet
- if *cash is used as the time to recognize a transaction, then we have **cash basis** accounting*
	- the former is used in almost all buisnesses
	- the latter is usefull for small bash based buisness

##### Double-Entry Accounting 

- uses **debits** and **credits** for each transaction

##### The T-Account

![[Pasted image 20210228163052.png]]

- **left hand side:** assests
- **right hand side:** liabilities and shareholders equity. 
- some account are considered **left hand side accounts**, where increaes in value are recorded on the left hand side. Others are considered **right hand accounts**.
- In double entry accounting **debits are left hand operations**, credits are **right hand operations**

![[Pasted image 20210228163302.png]]

- a debit on the left hand side account increases its value
- a credit on a right hand side account increases its value

![[Pasted image 20210228163552.png]]

- in the above example:
	- increase in cash: debit cash account
	- increase in common shares: credit common shares account

- **revenues are a right hand side account** because an increase in revenues increaes retained earnings
- **expenses are a left hand side account** because an increase in expenses decreases retained earnings

### Tara Inc Example

1. $50000 in cash recieved from shareholders
	- debit cash account by 50K (assets)
	- credit common shares account by 50K (equity)
2. $40000 of cash used for land
	- credit cash by 40K
	- debit land by 40K
3. 10K borrowed from bank (5-year loan, 8% interest payable yearly)
	- 10K debit to cash
	- credit 10K to long term debt
4. 3.7K purchased of office supplies on accounts payable
	- debit office supplies by 3.7K
	- credit accounts payable by 3.7K
5. received 7K cash (total is 12K) from clients for engineering work at the end of jan
	- cash is debited by 7K
	- acccounts receivable is debited by 7K
	- revenue is credited by 12K (recall temporary account)
6. performed services for King Inc on account and invoiced king inc for 3K at end of jan
	- accounts recievable is debited by 3K
	- revenues is credited 3K
7. throughout jan: 2.7K in expenses: 
	- cash is credited by 2.7 K
	- salary expenses are debited by 1.2K
	- office rent is debited by 1.1 K
	- utilities are debited by 0.4K
9. payed 1.9K on accounts payable at end of month
	- credit cash by 1.9K
	- debit accounts payable by 1.9K
10. collected 1K from king during months
	- cash is debitd by 1k
	- accounts recievable is credited by 1K
11. sold land for 22K
	- debit cash 22K
	- credit land 22K
12. payed 2.1K in dividends
	- credit 2.1K cash
	- debit dividends payed by 2.1K
13. interst on loan $67. Account for intrest expense that month (even though we haven't payed it yet)
	- debit interest expense account
	- credit interest payable 
14. Taxes for the month (20%)
	- take income before taxes and multiple by 20% to get taxes owed (we might not be paying them yet)
	- debit taxes expense account by 2447
	- credit taxes payable account by 2447 

- **for every credit there is a debit**

##### To generate income statment and balance sheet

- find balance for each account (debits - credits for left hand accounts, credits - debits for right hand side accounts)
- **close out** expenses and revenues to retained earnings.
	- **credit each expense account its balance, and debit retained earnings the same amount**
	- **debit revenues account its balance, and credit retained earnings the same ammount**
	- **find balance of retained earnings account**

### Financial Ratios

- quick an dirty method to interpret aspects of financial statments to determine the performance of a buisness (valuation)
- used to judge buisness performance relative to a competitor, the industry as a whole, or relative to the companies past

##### Financial Ratio Classifications

1. ability to pay current liabilities (**liquidity ratios**)
	- curent liabilities: debts the company needs to pay within a certain time period (usually a year)
	- **current ratio = (current assets)/(current liabilities)**
		- measures companies ability to pay current liabilities with current assets. 
		- The higher the current ratio, the better. 
		- Numbers below 1 could be a sign of concern. Compare to industry average
	- **acid-test ratio (aka quick ratio) = (cash + short-term investments + net current recievables)/(current liabilities)**
		- ability to pay current liabilites if they come due immediately 
		- nessecarily lower than current ratio
		- an acid-test ratio that is too high may indicate that a company is not efficient in using its cash as the industry average
2. abillity to sell inventory and collect receivables (**efficiency ratios**)
	- **inventory turnover = (cost of goods sold)/(average inventory)**
		- measures number of times the average level of inventory is sold in a year
		- reduce inventory levels to increase efficiency
		- higher number indicates an ability to quickly sell inventory
	- **day's inventory = (average inventory)/(COGS/365)**
		- inverse of inventory turnover ratio multiplied by the number of days in the period being analyzed
	- **accounts receivalbes turnover = (net credit sales)/(average net accounts recievable) or = (total sales)/(average net accounts recievable)**
		- measures a companies ability to collect cash from credit customers
		- a low accounts receivables turnover indicates that a company is not collecting cash on its sales quickly enough
	- **days receivables = (average receivables)/(sales/365)**
		- a longer days receivable (measured in days) means a company is allowing its customers more credit
		- larger days receivable means a greater chance that customers will not pay their dues
3. ability to pay long term debt (**leverage ratios**)
	- **debt ratio = (total liabilities)/(total assets)**
		- indicates proportion of assets financed by debt
		- more debt means greater risk, thus shareholders expect larger returns
		- higher debt ratio implies creater risk of bankruptcy 
	- **1- debt ratio = equity ratio = (shareholders equity)/(total assets)**
	- **times interest earned = (income from operations)/(interest expense) or = (EBIT)/(interest expense)**
		- measures a companies ability to meet its interest payments on its debt
		- EBIT: earnings before interest and taxes
		- operating income: profit after subtracting operating expenses
		- EBIT will include costs and profits not associated with running the buisness, so the numbers may differ
4. Profitability ratios (some of these fall into the performance ratio category)
	- **profit margin = (net income)/(sales)**
	- **return on assets (ROA) aka return on total assets**
		- meaures how profitably the company uses its assets 
		- few different formulas
			- **ROA = (net income)/(assets)**
			- **ROA = ((net incomes) + (interest)(1-taxes))/(assets)**
			- use average assets across period for the denominator
			- tax rate can be found with the income before taxes and income taxes numbers
	- **Return on equity (ROE) = (net income)/(equity)**
		- measures how much the company has earned on funds invested by shareholders
		- equity = common shares + retained earnings	= total shareholders equity
	- **Earnings per share (EPS) = (Net income)/(total shares outstanding)**
		- measures the profit of a company on a per-share basis
		- particularly important for investors
	- **Debt to equity D/E = (total liabilities)/(total shareholders equity)**
5. Analysis of shares as an investment (**performance ratios**)
	- ROA, ROE, and EPS are also considered performance ratios
	- **Price to earnings ratio P/E = (share price)/(EPS:earnings per share)**
		- high P/E could mean stock is overvalued or that investors are expecting high growth rates in the future
		- companies that have no earnings or are losing money do not have this ratio (no denominator)
		- leverage will impact a companies P/E ratio so be careful when comparing companies
	- **Dividend yield = (dividend per share)/(price per share)**
		- shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price
		- mature and stable companies are the most likely to pay dividends
		- high growth companies do not pay dividends
	- **Market capitalization = (price per share)(shares outstanding)**
		- not a ratio, but refers the total dollar market value of a companies outstanding shares of a stock
		- large-cap: 10 billion or more
		- mid-cap: 2-10 billion
		- small-cap: 300million to 2 billion
