# 12.1 Introduction 

- **primary function:** obtain oxygen and elimate CO2 from cells

## External Respiration

- entire sequence of events from exchange with external environemnt to exchange with cells (of CO2 and O2)
1. **ventilation (breathing)**: moving air in and out of the lungs
	- regulated based on bodies need for oxegen uptake and CO2 removal
	- exceptions: (see image below)
		- water loss and heat elimination
		- venous return
		- acid-base balance (blood pH)
		- speech and other vocalizations
		- defend against inhaled foreign matter
		- modifies substances passing through pulmonary circulation (eg prostaglandins)
		- smell organ (nose)
		- pressure for childbirth and defecation
		- lungs are resevoir of blood for left heart, helping to equalize output of right an left ventricles
2. oxegen diffuses from air in the alveoli into the blood within pulmonary capillaries (CO2 goes in opposite direction)
3. blood transports O2 from the lungs to the tissues and CO2 from tissues to lungs
4. O2 and CO2 are exchanged between tissues and blood via diffusion across systemic capillaries

- bronchi 

- two main components: lungs and chest wall
	- lungs have **airways** and **alveoli**
	
### Lungs

-	occupy most of chest cavity
-	two lungs, each divided into several lobes and supplied by one of the **bronchi**
-	lung tissue consists of highly branched airways, alveoli, blood vessels, and elastic connective tissue
-	upper airway has muscles that regulate diameter of **pharynx (throat)** and **larynx (voice box)**, present aspiration of food, and participate in vocalization
-	smooth muscle tone controls resistance to airflow 
-	alveoli have no muscles (they would interfere with diffusion)
-	changes in lung volume result from changes in thoracic cavity caused by **diaphram** and **internal** and **external** intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles

![[Pasted image 20210405175327.png]]

### Airways

- carry air between atmosphere and alveoli
- begin in **nasal passages (nose)**
- two tube lead from the pharanx:
	- **trachea** through with air is conducted to the alveoli
	- **esophagus** through which food passes to the stomach
- reflex mechanisms ensure that trachea is closed during swallowing
	- this control oringinates in the brain stem, where breathing rhythm is generated
- larynx is located at the entrance of the trachea
- **vocal folds** are two bands of elastic tissue that lie across the opening of the larynx. Laryngeal muscles control their length and shape to produce different sounds of speech
- The **adams apple** is created by the anterior protrusion of the larynx
- lips, tounge and soft palate modify vibrations into recognizable sounds
- during swallowing, vocal cords act to close the entrance to the trachea
- trachea divides into two branches: the right and left **bronchi** which enter the right and left lungs
- the **bronchus** continues to branch in the lungs into narrower and shorter airways.
- smaller branches are called **bronchioles**
	- the smallest are called **respiratory bronchioles**, because at this size, gas exchange through thin walls can occur
- **alveoli** are clusetered at the ends of terminal bronchioles, tiny air sacs where gases are exchanged between air and blood
- trachea and larger bronchi are rigid tubes surrounded by cartilagenous rings to resist airway compression
- in trachea, rings are incomplete (like a horseshoe) with the open segment connected by smooth muscle
- smaller bronchioles have no cartilage to hold them open, just have autonomically innervated smooth muscle 
	- sensitive to local horomoes and chemicals
- this allows for the regulation of the resistance to airflow
- airways -> convection
	- large calibre reduces resistance to flow
- alveoli -> diffusion
	- large surface area enhances diffusion
- transition to respiration to diffusion happens at respiratory bronchioles (see figure below)

![[Pasted image 20210405105512.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405110516.png]]

### Alveoli

- 300 million ish
- each about 300 micrometers in diameter
- inflatable grape like sacs
- terminal branches of conducting airways
- ideally structured for gas exchange
- composed of two types of epithelial cells:
	- **type I**: makes of alveolar walls (single flattened layer)
		- capillary walls are also one cell thick
		- this thin layer permits rapid diffusion (0.5 micrometers)
		- total surface area is approx 40 -100 m^2 
	- **type II**
		- secrete pumonary surfactant (see below)
- **pores of khan:** minute pores in the walls between adjacent alveoli permit airflow between them. this is known as **collateral ventilation**. Allows fresh air to enter an alveoli even if its supplying bronchi are blocked because of disease.

### Chest Wall

- **intercostal muscles:**
	- two sets: external and internal
	- between ribs 
	- activated by **intercostal nerves** (T1 to T12)

- chest wall (**thorax**) is formed by 12 pairs of ribs which join the **thoracic verebrae** posteriorly (back) 
	- ribs 1-7 join the sternum anteriorly (front)
- **rib cage** protects lungs and heart
- **inspiratory muscles:** 
	- **diaphragm** 
		- large sheet of skeletal muscle
		- forms floor of thoracic cavity and seperates it from the abdominal cavity
		- penetrated only by the esophagus and blood vessels
		- innervated by **phrenic nerves** that originate from cervical spinal cord segments 3, 4 and 5
		- has a dome shape when relaxed
		- 1.7 mm thick at rest and ~6mm when contracting
		- central part: **crus** and **costal** (lateral) portion on each side
			- at rest costal portions are active
			- as respiratory demand increases, crus is activated as additional motor units are recruited
		- during inspiration: 
			- diaphram descends-> enlarges volume of thoracic cavity by increasing vertical dimension	
			- abdominal cavity moves outward (belly)
			- responsible for 75 percent of enlargement
	- **external intercostal muscles**
		- lie over internal intercostal muscles
		- contraction enlarges thoracic cavity in lateral and anteroposterior directions (side to side and front to back)
		- elevate ribs, moving sternum upward and outwards
		- stablizes chest wall -> increases respiration efficiency


- **expiratory muscles:**
	- **internal intercostal**
		- innervated by T1-T12
	- **abdominal muscles**
		- rectus abdominus
		- transverse abdominus
		- external and interal obliques
		- innervated by T7 to L1
	- inactive at rest in healthy individuals
		- recruited when ventilatory demand increases
		- coughing, sneezing, vomiting
	- can generate higher pressure than inspriation due to the importance of these protective reflexes
	
	- **pleural space:** 
		- lungs and other internal structures are covered by the visceral membrane (pleura)
		- inside wall of thorax is lined with parietal membrane (pleura)
		- space between these membranes (few mm of fluid) is called the **peural space (cavity or sac)**
		- **pleural fluid** lubriactes surfaces of two membranes as they slide past one another during breathing

# 12.2 Respiratory Mechanics

$$ Q = \frac{\Delta P}{R} $$

- flow = pressure/resistance
- pressure gradient overcomes stiffness of respiratory system, resistance to airflow, and inertia of the system

## Pressures In Respiratory System

1. **atmospheric/barometric pressure** $P_B$
	- pressure of atmosphere on objects on the earths surface
2. **alveolar pressure** $P_A$
	- pressure in the alveoli (aka **intrapulmonary pressure**)
3. **pleural pressure** $P_{pl}$
	- pressure outside the lungs but still in the thoracic cavity (in the pleural space)
	- closely approximates the **intrathoracic pressure** and the esophageal pressure.
	- averages -5 cmH2O at rest
	- negative because lungs want to collapse and thoracic cavity wants to expand
4. **transpulmonary pressure **$P_{tp}$ (also referred to as the recoil pressure $P_l$)
	- pressure gradient across lung wall = alveolar pressure - pleural pressure

![[Pasted image 20210405120747.png]]

## Mechanical Properties



![[Pasted image 20210405120940.png]]

- $P_l$ is pressure volume relationship in the lung
	- as lung volume increases, so does passive recoil pressure of lung $P_l$
	- always positive (expiratory)
- $P_w$ passive recoild pressure of chest wall. 
	- most negative (inspiratory) at minimum volume
	- positive above 60 percent volume (expiratory)
- $P_{rs}$ recoild pressure of repiratory system
	- sum of pressures in lung and chest wall
	- at **functional residual capacity (FRC)** pressures are equal and opposite -> no net pressure
	- at the end of passive respiration, FRC is reached (about 50 pecent capacity)
	- this ensures that gas exchange continues during expiration
	- slope is maximual at FRC => system compliance is maximal (mimimizes work to breath)
	- residual volume is 0% of vital capacity. At this point, only recoil of chest walls drives inspiration 


- slope of curve is called compliance 
	- units L/cmH2O
	- greatest at FRC

- average lung volume is 5.7 L in males and 4.2 L in females (healthy)
- lung volume at end expiration is about 50 percent of total lung capacity during quiet breathing (average about 2.2L)
- typical **tidal volume** is 0.5 L -> lung volume is 2.7 L on average at end inspiration
- during maximal expiration, lung volume can decrease to 1.2 L and 1 L in males and females respectively. Cant go all the way because small airways collapse at lower volumes, blocking air outflow

### Elastic Recoil

- two reasons for lungs wanting to collapse:
	- **elastic recoil** of tissues
		- elastin fibers in pulmonary connective tissues
	- **surface tension** of liquid lining the alveoli
		- contributes 70 percent of the lungs elastic recoil pressure
		- this was demonstrated by filling the lungs with saline, where the water molecules are far less attractive
		- resists increases in surface area
		- tends to expel alveolar gas
		- creates and inward directed pressure that makes expansion more difficult

![[Pasted image 20210405122735.png]]

### Alveolar Stability 

![[Pasted image 20210405165904.png]]

- **law of Laplace**: magnitude of collapsing pressure of bubbles:
	
$$ P = \frac{2T}{r}$$ 

- P: collaping pressure, T: surface tension, r: radius of bubble (alveoli)
- the smaller the alveolus, the greater the collapsing pressure
	- smaller albeoli will collapse and force their air into connected larger alveoli


![[Pasted image 20210405174524.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405174734.png]]

- factors resisting collapse:
	- **pulmonary surfactant:**
		- mixture of lipids and proteins secreated by type II alveolar cells 
		- dispereses in alveolar fluid lining and reduces surface tension
			- cohesive force between water and surfactant molecules is low	
		- two benefits:
			- increased pulmonary compliance -> reduced work to inflate the lungs
			- reduces recoil pressure of smaller alveoli more than larger alveoli. This means that alveoli of different sizes can exist. Minimizes tendency of small alveoli to empty into larger ones
				- smaller surface area of small aveoli -> higher density of surfactant -> reduced surface tension
	- **alveolar interdependance:**
		- if an alveoli begins to collapse -> neighbours are stretched towards collapsing alveoli (see figure below) -> recoil of neighbours exerts an expanding force on the collapsing alveoli, resisting its collapse. 

![[Pasted image 20210405123611.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405123735.png]]

#### Pneumothorax

- normally air does not enter pleural cavity
- if chest wall is punctured, air can flow into pleural space (down pressure gradient)
- known as **pneumothorax**
- alveolar and pleural pressure will equal or exceed atmopheric pressure
- lung collapses to unstretched size and thoracic wall expands to unrestricted size
- can also occur if air enters peural cavity through a hole in the lung
	- disease or overinflation of lung (**barotrauma**)
	- must carefully monitor ventilators

![[Pasted image 20210405123939.png]]

## Alveolar Pressure Changes

- pressure in alveoli must change relative to barometric pressure to inhale or exhale air
- transpulmonary pressure =  recoil pressure = alveolar pressure - pleural pressure =>
	- **alveolar pressure =  pleural pressure + recoil pressure**
	- we cannot change recoil pressure to change alveolar pressure (circular argument: recoil pressure of lung depends on lung volume but alvolar pressure is a function of lung volume)
	- pleural pressure must change
		- activating inspiratory muscles -> reduces pleural pressure (and visa versa)

![[Pasted image 20210405175516.png]]

### Onset of Inspiration : Contraction of inspiratory muscles

1. alveolar pressure equals atmospheric pressure (at end of last expiration)
2. thoracic cavity enlarges -> pleural pressure drops -> alveolar pressure drops
3. air flows into alveoli (typically alveolar pressure only drops 1 cmH2O)

![[Pasted image 20210405125001.png]]

### Onset of Expiration: relaxation of 	inspiratory muscles

1. inspiratory muscles relax
2. pleural pressure becomes less negative
3. alveolar presure is now positive and expiration starts

### Role of excessory inspiration muslces 

- deeper inspirations can be accomplished by contracting the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles more forcefully and by recruiting **accessory inspiration muscles**
	- in the neck 
	- raises sternum 
	- elevates first two ribs
	- further increases volume of thoracic cavity
	- increases inspiratory flow and tidal volume

### Summary Of Inspiration

- because lung recoil pressure cannot change as quickly as pleural pressure -> alveolar pressure decreases during inspiration (it takes time for gas flow to lung to increase volume and thus increase recoil) -> air flow into lungs
- towards end of inspiration, activity of inspiratory muscles declines and recoil pressure catches up to pleural pressure
- when they are equal (-8 cmH2O pleural and 8 recoil) ->inspiration stops
- cessation of inspiratory muscles -> pleural pressure increases (less negative -8 to -7 cmH2O) -> expiration starts

### Active Expiration 

- expiration is passive at rest
- **active expiration** rapidly empties lungs and usually ends at a lower end-expiratory volume. 
- increases tidal volume independent of inspiratory muscles and allows lungs to stay on more compliant part of pressure volume curve (as opposed to increasing end-inspiratory volume)
- abdominal muscles increase abdominal pressure -> increased pleural pressure  -> more forceful expiration 
- internal intercostal contraction -> pulls ribs downwards and inwards -> flattening chest wall -> decreasing thoracic cavity size
- these muscles also stablize the thoracic cavity aiding breathing (energy is spent to move air not abdominal contents)
- during forceful expiration
		- pleural pressure becomes positive but lungs do not collapse because alveolar pressure increases accordingly
		- alveolar pressure gradually decreases as expiratory flow occurs
		- at some point along the airways the pressure drops below the pleural pressure. this is known as the **equal pressure point**, where the **transmural pressure** switches from positive to negative (inside > outside to inside < outside)
		- this means the airway is under compression

![[Pasted image 20210405175831.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405180155.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405180319.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405180433.png]]

- pleural pressure leads lung recoil pressure
- trumpet players can expire 45 cmH2O more than you

![[Pasted image 20210405180818.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405180924.png]]


### Airway resistance and airflow

- **poiseuille's law:**
$$ R = \frac{8\eta}{r^4} $$
 - under normal conditions, this resistance is very low
 - only small pressure gradients are required to create flow
 - parasympathetic activity (at rest) promotes **bronchoconstriction**
	 - always a base tone level caused by ach secretion from vagus nerve
 - reduction in parasympathetic activity allows for **bronchodilation**
	 - also caused by sympathetic stimulation and the hormone epinephrine
	 - decreased vascular resistance via beta 2 adrenergic receptors accepting NE from sympathetic terminals
	 - activation of a-adrenergic receptors in parasympathetic ganglia may also suppress parasympathetic activity (decreasing tone)
 - peptidergic system also affects airway resistance  
	 - release of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) by inhibitory non-adrenergic-non-cholinergic parasympathetic (i-NANC) system causes dilation 
	 - compliementary e-NANC system causes bronchoconstriction via release of tachykinins like substance P
	 - many other bronchoconstrictory agents are released by mast and epithelial cells (histamine) or cells recruited by an immune response to an infection
 - skeletal muscle in larynx and pharynx can also control flow (control comes from brainstem)
 - resistance can be affected by swelling of mucosa in the nose and elsewhere
	 -	sympathetic agnoists narrow mucosal blood vessels reduce swelling (**decongestants**)

![[Pasted image 20210405131119.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405131928.png]]

## Chronic Pulmonary Disease

- narrowing of lumen of lower airways
- larger resistance -> larger P gradient required to maintain normal airflow
- eg. asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
- **asthma**
	- thickening of airway walls due to inflamation and histamine-induced oedema 
	- plugging of airways by excessive secretion of thick mucus
	- airway hyper-responsivness: constriction of smaller airways due to spasm of smooth muscle in their walls 
	- very common childhood disease and increasing 
	- attacks can be caused by allergens, irritants, and infections

![[Pasted image 20210408184412.png]]
- **COPD**
	- aka **emphysema** or **chronic bronchitis**
	- slowly damages airway, usually result of smoking, coal, asbestos, or silica (work exposure)
	- 600 million people worldwide
	- **chronic bronchitis:**
		- long term inflammation of lower airways
		- triggered by frequent exposure to cigarette smoke, polluted air, or allergens
		- thick mucus (irritants immobilize **ciliary mucus escalator**)
		- promotes bacterial infections (mucus is a good medium for bacterial growth)
		- lungs can become hyper inflated with trapped air
	![[Pasted image 20210408184735.png]]
		
	- **emphysema:**
		- collapse of smaller airways
		- breakdown of alveolar walls
		- caused by excessive release of desctructive enzymes like *trypsin* from alveolar macrophages as a defensive mechanism in repsonse to chronic exposue to irritants
		- this can overwhelm the capacity of the inhibitory protein (**alpha - antitrypsin**) which results in damage to the lung tissues
		- can also result from genetic incapability to produce alpha-antitrypsin
			- only treatment is lung transplant
	![[Pasted image 20210408184554.png]]

	- **difficulty breathing out**
		- expiration becomes more difficult than inspiration (for any disease that increases resistance)
			- smaller airways lack cartilagenous rings that hold larger ones open
			- they are held open by positive transmural pressure gradient (negative pleural pressure)
			- inspiration dilates airways passively due to greater positive transmural pressure -> decreased resistance 
			- -> greater difficulty during expiration with increased resistance (causes wheezing)
		- this still makes breathing in harder because of a higher end-expiratory volume -> **dynamic hyperinflation** (lung volume keeps increasing due to limited expiration)
		- also reduced compliance at higher volumes -> makes inspiration difficult and uncomfortable (lower tidal volume)
		- causes breathless sensation: **dyspnea**
		- damage to alveolar walls in emphysema causes alveoli to collapse during expiration even at rest -> higher end-expiratory volume to help hold airways open
			- often purse lips to move equal pressure point towards the mouth to try and keep airways open

## Lung volumes and capacities

- **spirometer** measures volume of air breathed in and out
	- air drum floating in a water filled container
	- drum rises and falls during breathing -> recorded with a moving pen on paper. Plot is called a **spirogram**
	- spirogram is calibrated to measure the volume 
	- modern devices use turbines to measure flow and then integrate over the curve to obtain changes in volume

![[Pasted image 20210408183518.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405142004.png]]

- **tital volume $V_T$**: volume of air entering or leaving the lungs during a single breath
	- average at rest = 500 ml
- **inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)**: extra volume that can be maximally inspired over and above the typical resting tidal volume 
	- average 3000 ml
- **inspiratory capacity (IC)**: maximal volume that can be inspired starting from the end of a normal quiet expiration ($IC = IVR + V_T$)
	- average 3500 ml
- **expiratory reserve volume (ERV)**: maximal volume that can be actively expired starting from the end of typical resting tidal volume 
	- average 1000 ml
- **residual volume (RV)**: volume of air remaining in lungs after maximal expiration
	- average 1200 ml
	- determined indirectly through gas dilution techniques involving inspiration of a known quantity of tracer gas (helium)
- **functional residual capacity (FRC)**: volume of air in lungs at end of normal passive expiration (FRC = ERV + RV). 
	- average 2200 ml
- **vital capacity (VC):** maximal volume of air that can be moved out during a single breath following a maximal inspiration. $VC = IRV  + V_T +ERV$
	- average 4500 ml
- **total lung capacity (TLC)**: maximum volume lungs can hold (TLC = VC + RV)
	- average 5700 ml
- **forced expiratory volume in one second ($FEV_1$)**: volume of air expired during the first second on a maximal expiratory effort starting from TLC.
	- usually expressed as ratio with forced vital capacity $FEV_1/FVC$
	- $FEV_1/FVC > 80\%$  in young healthy people
	- decreases with age
	- can estimate **maximum voluntary ventelation (MVV) L/min** by multiplying $FEV_1$ by 35. 


![[Pasted image 20210405142157.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210405143231.png]]

### Dynamic Lung Function and Respiratory Dysfunction

- **obstructive lung disease**
	- lower $FEV_1$ and cannot breath out to a low lung volume because airways close, trapping gas
	- FRC and RV are greater, but VC is smaller
	- under heading of COPD
![[Pasted image 20210408184438.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210408185000.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210408185020.png]]
- **restrictive lung disease**
	- less compliant lungs than normal (stiffer than normal lungs)
	- breaths at lower lung volume but can still breath out a normal or greater than normal fraction of vital capacity in the first second 
	- an example is pulmonary fibrosis
![[Pasted image 20210408185110.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210408185211.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210408185243.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210408185326.png]]
- can plot flow versus volume for insight:
	- first part of curve is **effort dependent**
	- second part of curve is **effort independent**
		- during this portion, a greater effort -> a greater pleural pressure -> compressed airways and higher resistance
![[Pasted image 20210405143516.png]]
- with COPD
	- early peak at a lower than normal value
	- maximal expiratory flow rate rapidly decreases to low value and stays low throughout expiration
	- expiration terminates prematurely due to closure of airways
- with restrictive disease:
	- reduced lung volume
	- cannot inhale as much
	- lower peak expiratory flow

### Why measured expiratory flow

- rapid breathing would cause decrease in partial pressure of CO2 in arterial blood
- cause systemic vasoconstriction
- reducing blood flow to extremities (numbness) and brain (light headedness)
- cannot be sustained and unethical
- we measure expiration because it is the limitation to ventilation in healthy individuals (4-6 sec to expirate to maximum vs 0.5 second to inspirate)
	- radius decreases during expiration -> increased flow resistance
	- shortening expiratory muscles reduces their force (length-tension relationship)
	- => decreased $\Delta P$ and increased $R$ -> decreased flow rate $Q = \Delta P/R$
	- during inspiration: same length tension deal, but resistance decreases due to inceased lung volume 

### Other causes of respiratory dysfunction

- impared diffusion of O2 and CO2 across alvelolar-capillary membranes
- reduced ventillation due to mechanical failure (neuromusclar diseases)
- inadequate pulmonary blood flow
- ventilation/perfusion abnormalities involving poor matchin of air to blood (and vice versa) so that gas exchange is impaired

### Pulmonary Alveolar Ventellation

- **minute ventilation:** volume of gas breathed during a minute
- $\dot{V}_E = V_T \times f$ where V_E is the minute ventellation, f is the respiratory rate, and V_T is the tidal volume 
- at rest V_E = 6 L/min (= 12 * 0.5)
- can be briefly voluntarily increased to 150 L/min
	- increased tidal volume first, then increased frequency 
- not all air will contribute to gas exchange due to anatomic dead space

### Anatomic Dead Space

- not all air reaches alveoli, some remains in conducting airways
- this volume is called anatomic dead space $V_D$
	- average 150 ml in adults
- influences efficiency of ventilation
- only 350 ml of the 500 ml inspirated participate in gas exchange

![[Pasted image 20210405145841.png]]

- during inspiration, inhale 500 ml
	- 350 enters alveoli
	- 150 remains in conducting airways
- at the end of inspiration, 150 ml of fresh air is in the airways
- during next expiration, 500 ml are expired
	- first the 150 that was in the dead space
	- then the remaining 350 from the alveoli
	- 500 ml also had to leave the alveoli -> first 350 goto atmosphere while 150 remain in airways
- on next inspiration, 150 ml air from dead space enter alveoli first (only 350 of fresh air enter -> rebreathing own air)

![[Pasted image 20210408182518.png]]

### Alveolar Ventillation
- to have a non zero **alveolar ventillation $\dot{V}_A$**, tital volume must exceed dead space

![[Pasted image 20210405150616.png]]

- note there is an error in the second to last row of the above table. It should be V_E = 0.2

- during exercise, wasted ventillation $V_D/V_E$ decreases and $V_A/V_E$ increases => higher efficiency of breathing
- cannot increase tidal volume too much with moving to the low compliance part of the pressure volume curve and increasing the required work to breath
	- therefore we first increase tidal volume then increase breathing rate

### Work of Breathing

- at rest:
	- energy is used to overcome
		- elastic recoil of lungs
		- and airway resistance
	- expiration is passive 
	- usually 3% of total body energy goes to breathing
- **high frequency osillator ventillation** ventillates the lungs at high frequences (600 bpm) to shake CO2 from the lungs, without the risk of barotrauma 

![[Pasted image 20210405151431.png]]

- low frequency and high tidal volume
	- high elastic component, low resistive component
- high frequency, low tidal volume
	- high resistive component, low elastic component
- in breathing we try and minimize both of these components (see graph)
	- wide range of frequencies where this can be achieved (8-16 bpm)
	- we rarely use frequencies outside this range at rest
- work of breathing increases in 4 situations:
	1. pulmonary compliance decreases (eg. pulmonary fibrosis)
	2. airway resistance is increased: COPD or asthma
	3. elastic recoil is decreased: eg emphysema, requires work from expiratory muscles
	4. when there is a need for increased ventillation (eg. exercise): more work required for larger tidal volumes and faster breathing	
		- may account for up to 15 percent of total energy usage 
- in people with poorly compliant lungs or chronic airflow limitations, work of breathing may increase to 30 percent of total energy usage at rest
	- may go up to 35-40 percent during moderate exercise

### Respiratory Trainers


- the device below is used to train expiratory muscles (increasing FEV_1, increasing expiratory reserve volume/functional residual capacity, strengthen expiratory muscles):

![[Pasted image 20210405181111.png]]

- the device (incentive spirometer) below allows for the training of inspiratory muscles 
- increased inspiratory capacity, increased total lung volume, increased inspiratory reserve volume, increased tidal volume
