- Skeletal muscle makes up ~40 percent of body weight in men and 32 percent in women 
- smooth and cardiac make up another 10 percent of body weight

### 7.2 Skeletal Muscle Structure

![[Muscle.jpg]]

- **tendon:** transfers force from muscle to bone
- **Epimysium:** fibrous tissue that bundles everything in the skeletal muscle
	- dense layer of connective tissue made of 
		- **collagen**
		- to a lesser extent; **elastin**
- **Muscle Fasicle:** structure holding muscle fibers 
- **Perimysium:** layer surrounding the muscle fasicle
- **endomysium:** layer surrounding the muscle fibers
- **Muscle Fibers (cells):**
	- contains lost of **mitochondria**
	- made of bundles of **myofibrils**
	- 10−100 μm diameter
	- 0.76 m, travels whole length of muscle
	- formed via fusion of **myoblasts** during embryonic development -> **multinucleated** and an abundance of mitochondria
- **Satalite cells:** muscle stem cells in case damage needs to be repaired
- **Sarcolemma:** membrane of the muscle cells
- **myofibril:** bundle of myofilaments: actin and myosin
- **myosin:** **thick filament**
	- 12 - 18 nm in diameter
	- 1600 nm in length
- **actin:** **thin filament**
	- 5-8 nm in diameter
	- 1000 nm in length

- **sarcomere**
	- **functional unit** of muscle cell: the smallest component that can perform all of the functions of the organ
	- smallest contractile unit
	- defined as the region between two **Z lines**
- **A bands (dark)**
	- thick filaments
	- do not change in length during contraction
- **H zone**
	- lighter area within A band where thin filaments do not reach
	- shrinks during contraction
- **M line** 
	- system of supporting proteins that hold thick filaments together vertically 
	- runs down center of H zone
- **I bands (light)**
	- space between ends of the thick filaments in adjacent sarcomeres
	- shrink during contraction
- **Z line:** flat cytoskeletal disc that connects the thin filaments of adjacent sarcomeres 
- **muscle growth** is achieved by adding new sarcomeres to the end of myofibrils, not by increasing the size of each sarcomere
- **titin:** 
	- highly elastic protein that connects the M line and the Z line along a thick filament
	- made of 30000 amino acids
	- stabilizes postion of thick filaments in relation to thin filaments
	- contributes to muscle elasticity (spring like)


##### Myosin

- thick filaments are made of hunderds of **myosin** molecules packed together
- each myosin molecule consists of two subunits, each shaped like a golf club with a head and intertwined tails
- each head has two sites:
	1. actin binding site
	2. ATPase site
		- the rate of ATPase activity defines the type of the muscle fiber

- the myosin heads form the cross bridges of the thick filaments
- 
##### Actin, tropomyosin, troponin
- **actin:** spherical molecules that form the structure of the thin filaments
- **tropomyosin:** thread like proteins that cover the actin sites that bind with the cross bridges during muscle contraction

![[Pasted image 20210327085717.png]]

- **troponin:** made of three polypeptide units
	- one binds to actin
	- one binds to tropomyosin
	- one can bind with Ca2+
- when not bound with Ca2+, troponin stabilizes the tropomyosin, allowing it to block cross bridge binding
- when bound to Ca2+, allows tropomyosin to slip away and expose binding sites for cross bridges

### 7.3 Molecular Basis for Skeletal Muscle Contraction
##### Cross Bridge Cycle

![[cross_bridge.jpg]]

- note: during the power stroke: P is released during and ADP is released afterwards. 

- sarcomeres contract via the **sliding filament mechanism**
	- thin filaments are pulled inwards towards the M band via **cross bridge cycling**
	- this is called **concentric contraction**
- each thick filament performs a **power stroke** on its 6 surrounding thin filaments in unison
- the cross bridges that attach to a given thin filament do not stroke in unison -> prevents slippage
- **rigor mortis** occurs in dead bodies when there is no ATP available so the myosin heads cannot release from the actin, causing prolonged stiffness of the muscles

##### Excitation coupling
- the series of events linking muscle exciation to muscle contraction. 

1. release of acetylcholine (ACh) at a neuromuscular junction (NMJ) via a motor neuron.
	- ACh binds to receptors on the **motor end plate**
	- This causes an action potential to be propogated across the muscle cell membrane (**sarcolemma**)
2. Action potentials spread down the **transverse tubules (T tubule)**
	- T tubules are dips in the surface membrane at the junction between the A and I bands (see picture below)
	- this membrane runs into the central parts of the muscle fiber
	- It induces permability changes in the **sarcoplasmic reticulum**

3. The **Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)** releases Ca2+ into the cytosol of the muscle fiber
	- modified endoplasmic reticulum
	- surround myofibrils like a mesh sleeve
	- segments are wrapped around the A and I bands
	- each segement has **lateral sacs (terminal cisternae)** which surround the T-tublues
	- The **lateral sacs** stores calcium ions
	- **foot proteins (aka ryanodine receptors)** (made of 4 subunits) extend from SR to the T-tubules
		- half of these proteins are zipped together with complementary receptors on the T-tubules called **dihydropyridine receptors** (voltage gated)
4. AP is propogated down the T-tublues ->dihydropyridine receptors are activated -> foot proteins release Ca2+ on lateral sacs of SR
5. Released Ca2+ allows for the cross bridge cycle to happen by binding to troponin -> topomyosin can slip away

6. **Relaxation**: Ca2+ is actively taken back into the SR (via **Ca2+ - ATPase pump**) when there is no longer an action potential. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) removes ACh from NMJ

##### Contractile Activity

- A single action potential lasts 1 - 2 ms
- contraction lags behind by 0.5 ms, this is called the **latent period**
- **contraction time** is the time from the onset of contraction to the peak tension. This averages 40-120 ms
	- fast twitch fibers (FT) and slow twitch fibers (ST) reach peak tension at different rates
	- FT fibers have faster ATPase activity on their cross bridges
- **relaxation time** is the time from peak tension until relaxation is complete 
	- usually 50 -200 ms
	- depends on muscle fiber type
	- ST fibers have lower density of SR and a slower uptake of Ca2+ 
	- three factors
		1. dissociation of Ca2+ from troponin 
		2. translocation of Ca2+ to near site of entry into SR
		3. uptake of Ca2+ into lateral sacs of SR by Ca2+ pump
