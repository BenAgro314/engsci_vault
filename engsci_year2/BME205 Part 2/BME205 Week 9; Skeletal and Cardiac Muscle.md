# Skeletal and Caridac Muscle

##### Types of contraction

- **at the level of the muscle:**
	- **concentric:** muscle shortens as it contracts (**dynamic**)
	- **eccentric:** muscle elongates as it contracts (**dynamic**)
	- **isometric:** muscle maintains its length during contraction (**static**)

- **at the level of the muscle fiber:**
	- **isotonic:** constant tension with a change in length
	- **isometric:** constant tension with no change in length

- **origin:** the end of the muscle attached to the more stationary part of the skeleton
- **insertion:** the end of the muscle attached to the moving part of the skeleton
- not all skeletal muscles are attached to bone:
	- eye muscle go from skull to eye
	- sphincters are not attached to bone at either end
	- tounge has a free end



## Contraction Strength

1. number of muscle fibers contracting 
2. firing frequency of each contracting fiber
- these strategies are not used equally between muscles:
	- small muscle rely mroe on 2, while large muscle rely more on 1

### Factors affecting each fiber 

##### Single muscle twitch

![[timing.jpg]]

##### Twitch summation and Tetanus

- **tetanus:** rapid twich summation resulting in maximum tension for a muscle fiber

![[twitch-summation.jpg]]

- ~60 Hz nessecary for max force and 100 Hz nessecary for tetanus (depend on the person, 60 Hz may cause tetanus)
- 8 -12 Hz for sub-maximal contraction, 30 hz for moderate force
- **at the cellular level:**
	- if APs are at a low frequency, there is enough time for Ca2+ to be taken back into the SR -> no summation
	- if a second AP occurs while there is Ca2+ still in the cytosol -> permits more cross bridge cycling and summation 
	- with higher AP frequencies -> higher cytosolic Ca2+ concentration


##### Length tension relationship

![[length-tension.jpg]]

- at **optimal length**
	- maximal cross bridge binding sites are accesible to the myosin heads
	- optimal overlap between thick and thin filaments
	- only myosin tails are found in the region where the thin filaments do not overlap
- at lengths greater than optimal
	- decreased number of binding sites -> unused cross bridges -> less tension 
- at lengths less than optimal
	1. thin filaments from opposite sides of the sarcomere become overlapped -> limiting cross bridge ability to bind to actin
	2. ends of thick filaments are forced into Z lines
	3. not as much Ca2+ released and reduced ability to remove troponin-tropomyosin complex (for unknown reasons)

![[length-tension2.jpg]]

##### Fiber Diameter

- larger diameter -> higher maximum force generation
- **hypertrophy: ** enlaring myofibrils
- **hyperplasia:** more myofibrils. Occurs when Z-disc filaments snap

##### Fiber Type

|     | Slow - Oxidative (type 1) | Fast - oxidative (type 2A) | Fast Glycolytic (Type 2X)| 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
Mitochondria | many | intermediate | few |
Capillaries | many | many | few |
Myoglobin content | high (red) | high (red) | low (white) |
Contractile velocity | slow | fast | fastest |
Rate of Fatigue | slow | medium | fast |
Diameter | small | large | large |
size of innervating motor neuron | smallest | medium | largest |

##### Fatigue 

![[Pasted image 20210327105342.png]]

### Number of active fibers (per motor unit) and number of active motor units

- **motor unit:** one motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers it innervates.
- the order of motor unit recruitment depends on the **size principle:** larger motor units are activated later
- also depends on type.
	- Type 1 -> Type 2A -> Type 2X are activated in that order (whith increasing exertion)
- **asynchronous stimulation of motor units** is used to prevent fatigue if the load is not too large

![[Pasted image 20210327105730.png]]

##### Velocity of shortening

- force and velocity are inversely related for concentric contractions
![[Pasted image 20210327122158.png]]
- force and velocity are inversely related for eccentric contractions

##### Heat

- muscles do work and thus generate heat
- in an isotonic contraction, muscle efficiency is about 25 percent (75 percent goes to heat)
- this helps maintain body temperature

##### Levers 

- **fulcrum:** joint that the lever arm rotates around
- **power arm:** between the fulcrum and where the load is applied
- **load arm:** between the fulcrum and the load
- **lever ratio = power arm/load arm**
- distance moved at muscle end =  (distance moved at load end) x (lever ratio)
- force at load end end = (lever ratio) x (force at muscle end)

### ATP and fiber types

### Contracile use of ATP
1. splitting ATP on the myosin heads by myosin ATPase provides energy to cock the myson heads
2. binding of fresh ATP molcule allows cross bridges to release from actin filaments
3. active transport of Ca2+ back into SR allows for relaxation

### Fatigue 

- **muscle fatigue:**
	- local increase in ADP and inorganic phosphate interfers with cross bridge cycling and blocks Ca2+ reuptake into SR
	- accumulation of lactic acid inhibits key enzymes in the energy producing pathways
	- accumulation of extracellular K+ (Na+ - K+ pump cant work quickly enough) causes local reduction in membrane potential -> decreased release of Ca2+ intercellularly by imparing coupling of voltage gated dihydropyridine receptors in the T-tubules and the Ca2+ release channels in the SR
	- depletion of glucose energy reserves 

- **central fatigue:**
	- CNS no longer adequetely acivates the motor neurons supplying the working muscles 

- **neuromusclar fatigue**
	-  inability to produce ACh fast enough in a motor neuron
	-  does not occur under normal physiological conditions

### Muscle fiber types within a single motor unit

- skeletal muscle fibers are innervated by alpha motor neurons
- different alpha motor neurons innervate type 1 and type 2 fibers
- **type 1**
	- slow twitch
	- innervated by alpha 2 motor neurons (smaller than alpha 1 motor neurons)
	- **type 1 (slow) oxidative**
			- lots of mitochondria
			- lost of myoglobin (red)
			- large capillary supply
- **type 2**
	- innervated by alpha 1 motor neurons (which are larger than alpha 2 motor neurons)
	- the smaller the neuron, the lower the activation threshold and the slower the conduction velocity of that motor unit
	- contraction velocity approximately 10x faster than slow twitch
	- note: the oxidative <-> glycolytic distinction is a spectrum not a binary: all muscle fibers produce energy in both of these ways
	- **type 2 (fast) oxidative**
		- lots of mitochondria
		- lost of myoglobin (red)
		- large capillary supply
	- **type 2 (fast) gyloclytic**
		- small capillary supply
		- lots of stored glycogen
		- lots of enzymes for glycolysis

### Cardiac Muscle

### Circulation Overview

- pulmonary circulation is the loop to the lungs
- systemic circulation is the loop to the rest of the body
- 

![[Pasted image 20210327175946.png]]

### Anatomy of the heart
- lies in **thoracic cavity** between sternum and **vertebrae** (at about the midline of the body)
- broad **base** at the top of the heart to a tapered **apex** at the bottom, which sits on the left side of the body

![[Pasted image 20210327180120.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210327193352.png]]

- the heart is a **dual pump**
	- two halves of the heart are seperated by a **septum**
	- this prevents mixing between deoxigentated and oxigenated blood
1. blood returns to the **right atrium** from the body through two veins 
	- superior and inferior vena cava
2. This blood flows into the right ventricle and is pumped into the **pulmonary artery**
3. The blood goes to the lungs where it loses CO2 and picks up O2
4. It returns to the **left atrium** through the pulmonary vein(s) and flows into the **left ventricle**
5. the blood in the left ventricle is pumped into the **aorta** and to the rest of the body
- systemic circulation is a series of parrallel pathways to each organ (system)
- pulmonary circulation is a low pressure, low resistance system and the systemic circulation is a high pressure, high resistance system -> left ventricle wall is thicker to deal with increased pressures
- both sides of the heart pump the same amount of blood (continuity)

![[Pasted image 20210327180144.png]]



##### Valves

- one-way pressure operated valves ensure unidirectional flow through the heart
- The **atrioventricular (AV) valves** are positioned between the atrium and ventricles on both sides of the heart. 
	- allow blood flow into the ventricles during ventricular **diastole** (relaxation)
	- prevent blood flow into the atria during ventricular **systole** (contraction)
	- **right AV valve** is also called the **tricuspid valve** and the **left AV valve** is also called the **bicuspid valve** or the **mitral valve**
		- these names are due to the number of **cusps** each valve has
	- the **chordae tendineae** prevent valve eversion
		- they extend from the valve cusps to the **papillary muscles** protruding from the ventrical walls
- the **semilunar valves** connect the ventricles and the major arteries
	- **aortic** and **pulmonary** semilunar valves
	- open only if the pressure in the ventricles exceeds  the arterial pressure
- there are no valves between the atria and the veins because the pressure in the atria not much higher than that in the veins and the sites where the vena cava enter the atria are partiall compressed during contraction

![[Pasted image 20210327180157.png]]

- a **fibrous skeleton** connects the atria and ventricles 
	- provides a rigid structure for cardiac muscle attachement
	- all the valves lie in the skeleton and thus in the same plane

##### The Heart Walls

![[Pasted image 20210327193550.png]]

- innermost layer (cell layer this or so): **endocardium**
	- interfaces with blood in the chambers
	- secretes special enzymes
- **myocardium**: heart muscle
- outermost layer: **epicardium** (aka the **viseral layer of the serous pericardium**)
- **pericardial cavity**: thin layer of fluid outside of the heart that surround the heart. This provides lubrication between the heart and the **pericadial sac**
- **pericaridum (two layers)**:
	- **parietal layer of the serous pericardium**: secretes fluid in the pericardial cavity
	- **fibrous pericardium**

![[Pasted image 20210327194215.png]]

##### Cardiac Muscle Fibers

- cardiac muscle fibers are joined end to end via **intercalated discs**
	- these consist of **gap junctions** that permit Ca2+ flow between cells and **desmosomes** which are an adhereing junction that mechanically hold the cells together
	- this permits the conductino of action potentials through the myocardium when initated by a pacemaker cell
	- the contract as a single **functional synctium**
	- no gap junctinos connect arterial and ventricular muscle cells (sperated by insulatory fibrous skeleton) -> a specialized conduction system connects these portions of the heart

![[Pasted image 20210327194845.png]]

![[Pasted image 20210327180215.png]]

### Electrical Activity of the Heart

![[heart-APs.jpg]]

Two types of cells 
1. contracile cells: do mechanical work of pumping, normally do not produce their own action potentials (99 percent of cells)
2. **autorythmic cells**: do not contract, specialized for initiating and conducting action potentials

![[Pasted image 20210328093957.png]]

##### Autorythmic cells

- slowly drift to threshold (called the **pacemaker potential**)
1. $I_f$ channels: **funny current**
	- causes inward motion of both Na+ and K+ -> slow depolarization of the pacemaker potential 
2. $I_{Ca,T}$ **T-type (transient) calcium channel**
	- open at lower membrane potentials than L-type
	- open during pacemaker potential before threshold
3. $I_{Ca,L}$ **L-type (slow) calcium channels**
	- open at threshold to produce peak of action potential (large Ca2+ influx)
4. $I_K$: falling phase is due to K+ efflux through potassium channels

##### Cardiac Contractile Cells

1. during rising phase of AP: opening of (fast) **voltage gated Na+ channels**
2. Transient outward flow of potassion through the **transiet K+ channel** $I_{to}$ counters influx of Na+ and causes transient repolarization.
3. The balance of ion flow created by the **slow L-type Ca2+ channel** creates the **plateau phase**
4. The **delated rectifier K+** channel dominates when the L-type Ca2+ channel and transient K+ channel are inactivated -> repolarization to resting membrane potential 
5. resting membrane potential is maintained by a channel called the **inward rectifier channel** which moves K+ both in and out of the cell to maintain RMP

##### Nodes

![[Pasted image 20210327200132.png]]

1. **Sinoatrial (SA) Node**: in right atrial wall near vena cava opening. 
2. **Atrioventricular node**: near septum, above the junction between the atria and ventricles
3. **bundle of His**: tract of specialized cells originating in the AV node and terminating in the interventricular septum. Here it divides into right and left branches that travel down the septum and travel back towards the atria along the outer walls
4. **purkinje fibers:** small terminal fibers that extend from the bundle of His and spread throughout the endocardial surface of the ventricular myocardium (small twigs of a tree branch)

##### Normal Pacemaker Activity
- different pacemakers have different natural rates of AP generation
- The SA node is the fastest, and thus typically is the pacemaker for the whole heart
	- note that the 70-80 bpm rate is usually modulated by autonomic activity 
	- the other pacemakers are forced to threshold prior to when they would naturally reach it due to pacemaker currents -> AV sets the rate for the whole heart
![[Pasted image 20210328084136.png]]

##### Abnormal Pacemaker Activity
- if the SA node shuts down, the next fasted node will take over (the AV node) and so on (although at a slower, usually unsustainable rate)
- these cells that take over all called **latent pacemakers**
- if impulse conduction between the atria and venctricles is blocked -> atria will deploarize at SA rate and ventricles will depolarize at purkinje fiber rate. This is called **complete heart block**
- artificial pacemakers can be used to remidy these issues
- an **ectopic focus** is an area of the heart (such as the purkinje fibers) that becomes overly excited and depolarizes more rapidly than the SA node.
	- a ventricular ectopic focus produced **premature ventricular contraction (PVC)**
	- the pacemaker activity will shift from the SA node to the more rapid ectopic focus

##### Cardiac Excitation
1. atrial contraction should be complete before the onset of ventricular contraction 
	- so the atrial contraction is not unproductive - against a closed AV valve
	- 20 percent of ventricular filling is achieved through the contraction of the atria
	- the is achieved by a delay in conduction at the SA node
2. each chamber of the heart needs to contract as a single unit to pump efficiently
	- random uncoordinated contraction is known as **fibrillation**
	- ventricular fibrillation rapidly causes death, but can be corrected with **electrical defibrillation**
3. both pairs of atria andvenctricles should contract (approximately) simultaneously

##### Conduction from the atria
1. **interatrial pathway** extends from the left to right atrium -> simultaneous atria contraction
2. **internodal pathway** extends from SA to AV node

##### Conduction between atria and ventricles
1. there is a slow conduction through the AV node call the **AV nodal delay** which allows the atria to become completely depolarized and contract before the ventricles

##### Ventricular Excitation
- majority of purkinje fibers terminate near endocardial surface -> conduction occurs through myocardial layer from inside of heart to outside by means of gap junctions 
- conduction through the purkinje fibers and bundle of his is very fast so that the ventricles contract in a synchronized manner (so the top doesn't contract before the bottom for example)
- see ![[BME205 Week 9; Skeletal and Cardiac Muscle#Electrical Activity of the Heart]] for more on the contracile nature of ventricular myocytes

##### Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum

- the L-type Ca2+ channels are located in the T-tubules of ventricular myocytes
- once inside the cell the Ca2+ can directly bind to the troponin-tropomyosin complex or it can cause the futher release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
- the SR has **ryanodine receptors** which are a Ca2+ release channel that are activated by Ca2+ 
- this is called **Ca2+ induced Ca2+ release**
- depending on the type of myocyte, up to 90 percent of the Ca2+ needed for contraction comes from the SR
- in cardiac muscle, the extent of cross bridge activity can be varied by modulating the amount of cytosolic Ca2+

##### Abnormal K+ and Ca2+ concentrations
- elevated levels of extracellular K+ result in a depolarized resting membrane potential and a tendency to develop ecotopic foci and cardiac arrhythmias
- evevated levels of Ca2+ in the ECF prolongs the plateau phase 
	- the prolongs contraction duration and reduces the rest between contractions

##### Long Refractory Period

- around 250 ms due to the long plateau phase
- cannot be restimulated until contraction is over
- this means summation and tetanic contraction cannot occur in cardiac muscle -> a tetanic contraction would be fatal because pumping would stop
- this occurs due to the inactivation of Na+ channels that were activated during the initial Na+ influx phase
