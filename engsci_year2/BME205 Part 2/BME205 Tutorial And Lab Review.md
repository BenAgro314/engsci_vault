# Mitral Valve Prolapse

- heart valves close and open due to pressure differences on the two sides of the valve
- the first heart sound occurs when the AV valves (mitral and tricuspid) close at the onset of ventricular systole
- insufficient AV valve -> does not close properly during systole -> there will be backflow into the atria (produces a gurgling systolic murmur)
- stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped out of each ventricle (EDV - ESV)
- cardiac output is the product of stroke volume and heart rate
- papillary muscles function to stop the AV valves from inverting
- damage to the left papillary muscles would mean that the left AV valve (mitral) could invert
- mitral valve prolapse allows blood to flow out of the left ventricle to the left atrium during systole
- mitral valve prolaps does not change stroke volume	
- this reduced **forward stroke volume and forward cardiac output (ie to the aorta)**
	- this reduces systolic blood pressure
	- HR will raise to compensate
- pulmonary blood pressure will increase due to backflow
- this will cause more fluid to leave the capillaries in the lungs and enter the air sacks -> wet breath sounds
- decreased blood pressure will cause flitration in the kidneys to decrease and potentially lead to kidney failure


- mitral valve prolapse can result from damaged papillary muscle on the left side of the heart
- this reduces forwards stroke volume because blood backs up into the atria
- cardiac output is reduced
- blood pressure in the systemic system is reduced
- heart rate increases as a compensatory measure
- pulmonary circulation will decrease due to backflow
- pulmonary pressure will increase => inrceased capillary filatration in the lungs => **rales (wet breath sounds)**
- breathing rapidly to compensate

# Fetal Heart

- fetal heart capillaries receive oxegen from the placenta
- fetal heart adaptations
1. umbilical vein
	- carries oxegenated blood from the placenta back towards the liver area
	- at the umbilical vein, it can either go through all the capillaries in the liver, or take a shortcut through the ductus venous
2. dutus venous 
	- this is shortcut to the inferior vena cava
	- this partially oxegenates the blood from the lower extremities
	- dumps blood into right atrium
	- blood in the right atrium can go to the right ventricle -> pulmonary artery -> lungs
	- the lung air sacs are full of fluid with little blood vessels going past them
	- the means there is not much oxegen
		- this causes hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction
		- this leads to high resistance in the lungs and high blood pressure (P = QR)
		- this means there is a lot of pressure in the right atrium and right ventricle (right side of heart)
		- this causes blood to flow from the right atrium across the **foramen ovale** to the left atrium
3. Foramen ovale (right to left shunt)
	- not much blood comes back through the pulmonary veins, so blood flow coming from right atrium helps to replace this
	- blood is squeezed from the left ventricle into the aorta
4. Ductus arteriosus (right to left shunt)
	- allows blood to go from the pulmonary artery to the aorta
	- there are high pressures in the pulmonary artery
5. Umbilical Artery
	- a major branch off of the internal illiac arteries
	- returns blood back to the placenta
	- placenta has a very low resistance
	- this causes blood to divert towards it

- a ventricle septal defect allows blood flow from left to right ventricle
- this increases the blood flow to the right ventricle and thus to the lungs -> congestion due to high blood pressure in pulmonary arteries
- pulmonary circulation is less in the fetus due to collapsed lungs
- 130-160 HR is normal in a human fetus
- cyanosis: blue skin coloration produced by low O2 levels in the tissues
- mitral valve prolaps corresponds to a whirring sound between the lub and dub (during systole)

# Hot tub mystery

- heat => vasodilation and reduced peripheral resistance => reduced blood pressure + sweating
- alcohol =>
	-  narcotizes the brain preventing normal responses to decreased blood pressure
	- vasodilation due to increased decreased sympathetic stimulation
	- dehydration due to interference with anti-diuretic hormon (ADH) 
- Effect of lasix on body:
	- loop diuretic (water pills)
	- decreases fluids in body by increasing amount of salt and water lost in the urine
	- helps with swelling from congestive heart failure or liver disease and kidney disease
	- reduces BP
- low bp => loss of conciousness

![[Pasted image 20210419114338.png]]increased PCO2 shifts curve right (down) and visa versa

# Into Thin Air

- altitude sickness:
	- bodies reaction to low O2 levels at high altitudes
- the pulmonary response to high altitude is hyperventillation
	- acute adpatation to high altitude and low O2 is by hyperventillation which improves O2 saturation.
	- hyperventillation: increased ventillation rate independent of cellular O2 needs, leading to abnormally low CO2 levels and high blood pH
	- contrast this with **hyperpnea** which is an increased depth and rate of ventilation to meet and increased O2 demand
- hyperventillation makes it harder to unload PO2 because there is less CO2 (bohr effect)
- 2,3 DPG is a glycolyssi intermediate in erythrocytes which accumulates when peripheral tissues are hypoxic.
	- this casues a reduced affinity of Hb for O2 => shifts dissociation curve right => enhanced unloading
- increased EPO production => higher hematocrit (number of red blood cells)
	- released from the kidney (a processs called polycythemia)
	- stimulates bone marrow to make more red blood cells
- **gammow bag** is a portable hyperbaric chamber used for treatment of acute mountain sickness. 
- how to test for HAPE:
	- neurologic test for brain swelling
	- lung function (check for fluids in lungs)
	- heart rate and blood pressure
	- blood test to measure blood gases and kidney function
- expectation with HAPE:
	- increase HR
	- increase BP
	- decreased blood O2 levels
	- increased hematorcrit
	- decreased lung fuction 
	- incomplete renal compensation
	- respiratory quotient R = CO2 production/O2 consumption
	- a low R indicates that mark's body is not metabolizing fuel properly (he is moving towards an anaeroblic metabolism)

$$ P_{AO2} = P_{iO2} - P_{ACO2}/R$$

$$P_{AO2}$$ is the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen
$$P_{iO2}$$ is the inspired pressure oxygen (inspired oxygen tension)
$$P_{ACO2}$$ is the avolar partial pressure of CO2
$$R$$ is the respiratory quotient
![[Pasted image 20210419115218.png]]

HAPE:
- decreased oxygen at altitude -> decreased arterial oxygen -> uneven pulmonary vasoconstriction -> pulmonary hypertension -> overperfusion -> increased capillary pressure -> capillary stress failure -> leakage of capillaries -> HAPE

![[Pasted image 20210419151033.png]]

# Asthma Attack

Factors leading to asthma attack:
- swelling of airways
- increased mucus production
- bronchoconstriction
- any bronchoconstrictino ontop of their elevated basline inflamation can lead to an asthma attack
- swelling -> increased resistance -> increased pressure gradient required to maintain ventillation -> increased muscle contraction 
	- may require: scalenes, sternocleidomastoid, serratus anterior, pectoralis minor, and upper trapezius
	- this requires more energy and can make breathing tiring 
- harder to breath out -> harder to get rid of CO2 -> higher partial pressure of CO2 -> more O2 dissociating than normal

- tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume and expiratory volume will all decrease during an asthma attack

- quick relief inhaler contain albuterol, a bronchodilator
	- opens up airways -> lower resistance to airflow (asthma is an obstructive pulmonary disease)
- nebulized albuterol is a fine liquid mist delivered to the lungs through an oxygen mask for an extended period of time.



# ECG Lab

- leads arranged on left and right side of chest
- using Photoplethysmography to measure volumetric blood changes
	- uses optical methods to detect pulsations in blood flow 
	- on finger
	- red LED and sensor on other side of the skin
	- measures how much light is transmitted through finger
	- allows for a calculation of heart rate and a visualization of heart rate changes across time
	- needs to be pressing into finger but not hard to permit bloodflow
	- gives a flow rate curve (similar to those seen in wiggers, but different because it is in the finger)
	- non-zero diastolic flow due to recoil of arteries
- color word test used to simulate mental exertion to measure the effect on heart rate (exertion should result in a rise of heart rate)
	- this effect was minimal in the lab
- holding breath had little effect on heart rate (without the diving reflex), amybe should decrease a bit
- breathing out with a closed mouth (valsalva):
	- should have a heart rate drop at the beginning 
	- then a gradual rise as you continue (see image below)

**valsalva:**
Based on the characteristic hemodynamic changes, Valsalva maneuver divides into four phases.

Phase I, which corresponds to the onset of strain, is associated with a transient rise in blood pressure because of emptying of some blood from the large veins and pulmonary circulation.

Phase II follows this when positive intrathoracic pressure leads to a reduced venous return to the heart. Because of reduced venous return and thus reduced preload, stroke volume falls; this leads to a fall in blood pressure activating the baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. Vagal withdrawal followed by increased sympathetic discharge ensues, leading to marked tachycardia, increased cardiac output, and vasoconstriction which leads to the recovery of blood pressure to the normal values in healthy individuals.

Phase III is the transient phase involving the release of strain which leads to a sudden dip in blood pressure. The release of positive pressure leads to expansion of the pulmonary vascular bed and reduces left ventricular cross-sectional area resulting in a transient fall in blood pressure.[6]

Phase IV is the overshoot of the blood pressure above the baseline, which is because of resumption of normal venous return to the heart stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system during Phase II. The overshoot of blood pressure leads to stimulation of baroreflex leading to bradycardia and return of blood pressure to the baseline.[4][7]

- **diving reflex**: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_reflex

When the face is submerged and water fills the nostrils, sensory receptors sensitive to wetness within the nasal cavity and other areas of the face supplied by the fifth (V) cranial nerve (the trigeminal nerve) relay the information to the brain.[1] The tenth (X) cranial nerve, (the vagus nerve) – part of the autonomic nervous system – then produces bradycardia and other neural pathways elicit peripheral vasoconstriction, restricting blood from limbs and all organs to preserve blood and oxygen for the heart and the brain (and lungs), concentrating flow in a heart–brain circuit and allowing the animal to conserve oxygen.[3][6]

In humans, the diving reflex is not induced when limbs are introduced to cold water. Mild bradycardia is caused by subjects holding their breath without submerging the face in water.[10][11] When breathing with the face submerged, the diving response increases proportionally to decreasing water temperature.[8] However, the greatest bradycardia effect is induced when the subject is holding their breath with their face wetted.[10] Apnea with nostril and facial cooling are triggers of this reflex.[1][8]

- profs heart rate went below 70 bpm due to diving reflex

### Exercise

- **increased atrial contraction**
	- at rest: one cardiac cycle is 800 ms with 300 ms for systole and 500 ms for diastole
	- during exercise, diastolic duration is reduced more than systolic duration (500 ms to 125 ms with a 180 bpm heart rate)
	- reduces time for ventricular relaxation and filling
	- relative contribution of atrial contraction is increased at higher heart rates
- **increased motor unit recruitment and rate of AP firing**
	-	more skeletal muscle activity causes higher PCO2, higher temperature, and higher concentrations of local metabolites like H+
		- by Bohr effect this increasest the dissociation of O2 from the Hb at the skeletal muscles, helping to satisfy their oxygen needs
	- local metabolites cause local vasodilation => more blood flow to skeletal muscles
- increased PCO2 and H+ will be detected by central and peripheral chemoreceptors 
	- increased breathing rate and depth via VRG and DRG control centers
- increased pulmonary blood pressure will open closed arteries supplying alvolvi at the top of the lungs => increased diffusion of oxygen
- **sympathetic stimulation** (and reduced parasympathetic tone)
	- generalized vasoconstriction => increase in MAP
	- epinephrine release => aterioles in skeletal muscles and heart dilate (this is also cause by local factors), which diverts blood to them
	 - sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic => bronchodilation
	 - sympathetic venous vasoconstriction => higher venous return and thus higher stroke volume by frank-starling mechanism
	 - increased HR and contractility of ventricles => increased cardiac output
	 - increased blood flow to skin (via local vasodiation) will help with sweat production and temperature regulation
- **breathing**
	- chemoreceptors will signal the VRG and DRG to increase the rate and depth of breathing 
	- this will help maintain partial pressures in spite of increased demand for O2 and increased production of CO2
	- faster and deeper breathing will also enhance the respiratory pump to increase venous return

### Case Study Notes

- **Orthostatic hypotension** is the phenomenon whereby arterial pressure decreases when one stands up. blood pools in the legs due to high venous capacitance, reducing venous return and thus cardiac output by frank-starling. Transient reduced blood flow to brain can result from standing up quickly. 
	- baroreceptors in aortic arch and carotid sinus will cause:
		- increase HR by B1 on SA node
		- increased ventricular contractility via B1 in ventricular muscle
		- arteriolar and venous vasoconstriction via alpha 1
- **during exercise** we want to maintin adequate blood flow to the tissues that need it
	- metabolites include lactate, K+, nitric oxide, and adenosine
	- TPR decreases during exercise meaning diastolic pressure drops
![[Pasted image 20210421180519.png]]
- **shock:** a condition in which decreased blood flow causes decreased tissue
perfusion and O2 delivery
	- **Hypovolemic shock** occurs when circulating blood volume is decreased because of loss of whole blood (hemorrhagic shock), loss of plasma volume (e.g., burn), or loss of fluid and electrolytes (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea). **Cardiogenic shock** is caused by myocardial impairment (e.g., myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure). **Mechanical obstruction** to blood flow can occur anywhere in the circulatory system and cause a local decrease in blood flow. **Neurogenic shock** (e.g., deep general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia, spinal cord injury) involves loss of vasomotor tone, which leads to venous pooling of blood. **Septic or anaphylactic** shock involves increased filtration across capillarywalls, which leads to decreased circulating blood volume.
	- hypovolemic: decreased venous volume => decreased venous return => decreased CO => decreased blood pressure
	![[Pasted image 20210421182617.png]]
	- In the first hours after hemorrhage, it is true that hematocrit is unchanged. However, as plasma volume is restored (as a result of increased aldosterone levels, increased capillary absorption of fluid, and the infusion of saline), plasma volume increases, but red blood cell volume does not. (It takes about 7 days for stem cells to become mature red blood cells.) Therefore, Mrs. Byrne’s hematocrit was decreased by dilution
	- At high altitude, barometric pressure is decreased, resulting in decreased partial pressure of atmospheric gases, such as O2. If Celia had traveled to Denver, she would have breathed air with a lower Po2 than the air at sea level. Such alveolar hypoxia produces vasoconstriction in the pulmonary circulation (normally a protective mechanism in the lungs that diverts blood flow away from hypoxic areas). Celia’s pulmonary vascular resistance was already abnormally elevated as a result of her intrinsic disease. The so-called hypoxic vasoconstriction at high altitude would have further increased her pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure
	- **left sided heart failure** The decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction caused blood to “back up” in the left side of the heart, increasing left ventricular and left atrial pressures. The increase in left atrial pressure led to increased pulmonary venous pressure. The increase in pulmonary venous pressure led to increased pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure (Pc), which is the major Starling force favoring filtration of fluid into the pulmonary interstitium (see Case 16 and Fig. 2–13). When the filtration of fluid exceeded the capacity of Marvin’s pulmonary lymphatics to remove the fluid, pulmonary edema occurred. Initially, the excess fluid accumulated in the interstitial space, but eventually it also “flooded” the alveoli. Pulmonary edema is dangerous because it compromises gas exchange in the lungs. Although this discussion is more the venue of pulmonary physiology, briefly, pulmonary edema increases the diffusion distance for O2. When the diffusion distance increases, there is decreased diffusion of O2 from alveolar gas into pulmonary capillary blood. In addition, pulmonary blood flow is shunted away from alveoli that are filled with fluid rather than with air (i.e., hypoxic vasoconstriction). As a result, there is impaired oxygenation of pulmonary capillary blood, which causes hypoxemia(decreased Po2 of arterial blood). Hypoxemia is an important cause of hypoxia (decreased O2 delivery to the tissues).
	- **ventricular septal defects:** During normal systole, all of the cardiac output of the left ventricle flows into the aorta. When a ventricular septal defect is present, a portion of the output of the left ventricle flows through the shunt to the right ventricle (Fig. 2–15). This shunted blood is added to the blood already in the right ventricle, increasing right ventricular end-diastolic volume. On the next beat, because there is increased right ventricular end-diastolic volume, there is increased right heart cardiac output (Frank–Starling mechanism), increased pulmonary artery blood flow, increased venous return to the left atrium, and increased filling of the left ventricle.
	- **why defects arnt seen before birth:** Before birth, there is no alveolar ventilation, and consequently there is alveolar hypoxia throughout the lungs. Global alveolar hypoxia causes vasoconstriction throughout the lungs (hypoxic vasoconstriction), which increases pulmonary vascular resistance. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance leads to increased pulmonary artery pressure and increased pressures on the right side of the heart; during systole, the right ventricular pressure will be as high as the left ventricular pressure. Thus, the ventricular septal defect does not cause a significant shunt prenatally because there is not a favorable pressure gradient between the left and right ventricles. At birth, alveolar ventilation begins, there is reversal of hypoxic vasoconstriction, and consequently there is a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and pressures on the right side of the heart. When the right ventricular pressure becomes less than the left ventricular pressure during systole, flow through the shunt begins.

	- During exertion, Joe fainted (syncope) secondary to decreased arterial pressure. At rest, his left ventricle was able to maintain cardiac output (and arterial pressure): by increasing left ventricular pressureto very high levels, a normal cardiac output could be forced through the aortic valve. During exertion, however, he was unable to increase his cardiac output through the stenotic valve. Recall thatduring exercise, there is arteriolar vasodilation in skeletal muscle that results in decreased TPR. Decreased TPR, combined with a lack of increase in cardiac output, results in a decrease in arterial pressure (Pa = cardiac output × TPR), a decrease in cerebral blood flow, and syncope
	- Dan’s breathing rate would be increased (**hyperventilation**) because decreased Pao2 stimulates peripheral chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies located near the bifurcation of the common carotid arteries. When Pao2 is less than 60 mm Hg, these chemoreceptors are strongly stimulated. This information is then relayed to medullary respiratory centers (the **dorsal respiratory group**) that direct an increase in breathing rate. In other words, the body is calling for more O2!
	- **HAPE** **P50 would be increased because there is a right shift of the O2 –hemoglobin dissociation curve on ascent to high altitude. **This right shift occurs because hypoxemia stimulates the synthesis of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). 2,3-DPG binds to hemoglobin and decreases its affinity for O2. This decreased affinity is a helpful adaptation at high altitude that facilitates unloading of O2 in the tissues. **Pulmonary artery pressure would be increased** because alveolar hypoxia causes vasoconstriction of pulmonary arterioles (hypoxic vasoconstriction). Vasoconstriction leads to increased pulmonary vascular resistance, which increases pulmonary arterial pressure. (Recall from cardiovascular physiology that arterial pressure = blood flow × resistance.) Hypoxic vasoconstriction is a unique phenomenon in the lungs that shunts blood flow away from hypoxic regions; in contrast, in other tissues, hypoxia is vasodilatory
	- **asthma:** The first mechanism (bronchoconstriction) can be reversed by administering bronchodilator drugs such as b2 -adrenergic agonists (e.g., albuterol. Airway resistance is especially increased during forced expiration, when intrapleural pressure becomes positive and tends to compress, or even close, the airways (Fig. 3–7). Therefore, FVC decreases during an asthma attack because the airways close prematurely during expiration. One result of this **premature closure of the airways is that air that should have been expired remains in the lungs (air trapping).**
	- The bronchitic component of Bernice’s **COPD (chronic bronchitis)** caused narrowing and obstruction of her airways. The resulting increased resistance of the airways caused a decrease in airflow, especially during expiration. Because the expiratory phase was compromised, air was trapped in the lungs, and residual volume was increased. Because FRC includes residual volume, FRC was also increased. The **emphysematous** component of Bernice’s disease (emphysema) caused decreased elasticity of her lung tissues, which also compromised expiration. The “hint” in the question suggests that Bernice had edema on the systemic side of the circulation (in the ankles) because of problems in her lungs. In patients with COPD, pulmonary artery pressure is often elevated secondary to increased pulmonary vascular resistance. Pulmonary vascular resistance is increased for two reasons. (i) **COPD is associated with loss of alveolar–capillary units. The loss of capillary beds increases pulmonary resistance**. (ii) **Alveolar hypoxia (secondary to hypoventilation) causes hypoxic vasoconstriction.** The increased pulmonary vascular resistance leads to increased pulmonary artery pressure, which is the afterload of the right ventricle. Increased afterload on the right ventricle causes decreased cardiac output, or cor pulmonale (right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary hypertension).
	- it is important to understand that **restrictive pulmonary diseases (e.g., interstitial fibrosis) are associated with decreased compliance of lung tissues.** Because the lungs are stiff and noncompliant, greater changes in pulmonary pressures and greater effort are needed to expand the lungs during inspiration. As a result, all lung volumes and capacities are compromised (or decreased). 
	- A **pulse oximeter** is a dual-wavelength spectrophotometer that measures absorbance at two wave lengths. Oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin have different absorbances, and the machine calculates % O2 saturation (oxyhemoglobin) in arterial blood of the finger. The reason the pulse oximeter detects arterial % O2 sat is the “pulse” part. Background absorbance from venous and capillary blood is subtracted out (because they are steady in the background), whereas arterial blood is “pulsing” and is detected. Pulse oximetry normally measures % O2 saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood—it does not directly measure PO2. Knowing %saturation,one can estimate PO2 from the O2–hemoglobin curve
