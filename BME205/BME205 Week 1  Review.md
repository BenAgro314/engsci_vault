# Week 1

**Textbook sections:**  1.1-1.4

### 1.1 Introduction to Physiology (3-4)

**Physiology:** the study of the functions of the human body

Approaches:
- **teological**: purpose/bodily need
- **mechanistic**: cause-and-effect

**Anatomy:** Study of structure

### 1.2 Levels of Organization in the Body (4-8)

##### Levels of organization:
- chemical
- cellular
- tissue
- organ
- organ system
- organism

**Cell differentiation:** cells becoming specialized to perform a particular function

##### 8 basic cell functions:
1. Obtaining **nutrients ** and $O_2$ from the environment
2. Creating **energy** from nutrients 
3. Discarding **waste** products and $CO_2$
4. Controlling the **entry** and exit of materials 
5. **Moving** around the environment and moving materials internally 
6. **Synthesizing** products and growth
7. **Responding** to changes in the external environemnt 
8. **Reproduction ** (some cells)

##### Four Types Of Tissues
- **Muscle **
	- contractile activity 
	- smooth, cardiac and skeletal
	- moves material through tubes (peristalsis)
	
Characteristic|skeletal|smooth|cardiac|
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
Striated|✓|✘|✓|
Multinucliated|✓|✘|✘|
Voluntary|✓|✘|✘|
Branched|✘|✘|✓|

- **Nervous **
	- neurons and glial cells
	- long distance communication and signalling
- **Epithelial **
	- control the passage of materials from between the body and the external environemnt 
	- specialize in exchange
	- cells are polarized: **apical side ** (facing lumen) and **basolateral side** (facing blood) have different functions. 
	1. **Epithelial Sheets:** serve as boundaries (ie. skin, stomach lumen lining)
	2. **Glands**:  pockets of epithelial tissue dip inwards during development.
		- exocrine: excretes outside the body (ie. sweat glands). If connecting cells to invagination remain intact. 
		- endocrine: excretes horomones inside the body (ie. pancreas and insulin). Invagination is isolated from surface during development. 
- **Connective**
	- relatively few cells dispersed within an extracellular material 
	- anchors, supports, and connects 
	- tendons, bones, blood

**Organs:** two or more tissue types working together to perform a particular function



### 1.3 Concept of Homeostasis (9-13)

**Homeostasis:** the ability of a cell or organism to control its internal environment, typically using feedback mechanisms to maintain parameters around a set point or within a **physiological range**. This represents a **dynamic equillibrium** or a **steady state**. 

**ICF: intracellular fluid**
**ECF: extracellular fluid**, consists of plasma (the fluid portion of the blood) and interstitial fluid. 

##### 7 homeostatically regulated factors

1. Concentration of nutrients 
2. Temperature
3. pH
4. Concentration of water, salt, and electrolytes 
5. Volume and pressure
6. Concentration of waste products
7. Concentration of $CO_2$ and $O_2$

##### 11 body systems and their homeostatic role:
1. nervous: major regulatory and rapid communication system.
3. endocrine: major regulatory and communication system.
4. integumetary: outer protective layer, body temp. 
5. skeletal: protection and support, storage of calcium. Source of blood cells. 
6. muscular: movement and response. 
7. respiratory: intake of $O_2$ and removal of $CO_2$.
8. circulatory: transports nutrients, $CO_2$, $O_2$, wastes, electrolytes, horomones. 
9. digestive: obtain nutrients from food and eliminate wastes. 
10. reproductive: prepetuation of species. 
11. immune: defend against invaders
12. urinary: remove excess water, salt, acid, and other electrolytes. 

### 1.4 Homeostatic Control Systems (14-16)

**Intrinsic control:** built into an organ, local mechanism to maintain homeostasis.
**Extrinsic control:** regulatory mechanism where one organ acts on another to maintain homeostasis. Permits synchronized regulation as opposed to self serving intrinsic control. 

##### Components of a homeostatic feedback mechanism:
1. sensor/receptor
2. afferent pathway
3. integrator/control center
4. efferent pathway
5. effector

##### Types of feedback

**Negative feedback:** 	a change in a homeostatically regulated factor triggers a response that acts to move the homeostatically regulated factor in the opposite direction to the initial change. 

**Positive Feedback:** output of the effector acts to enhance or reinforce the change in the homeostatically regulated varaible. 
- more rare than negative feedback
- childbirth, clotting, voltage gated (VG) Na+ pumps opening 
- heatstroke: integrating center can become impared 

**Feedforward Mechanism:** reactions occur in anticipation of a change in a regulated variable. Eg. preemptive insulin secretion in the digestive tract. 

**Pathophysiology:** abnormal functioning of the human body associated with disease or injury.
