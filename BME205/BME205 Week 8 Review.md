# Week 8
**Textbook sections:** 7.1-7.3

### 7.1 Introduction (297-298)

- **skeletal muscle:** striated, voluntary, multinucliated
- **cardiac muscle:** striated, involuntary
- **smooth muscle:** unstraited, involuntary

### 7.2 Structure of Skeletal Muscle (298-)

##### muscle fiber (cell)

- roughly cylindrical 10-100 micrometers in diameter and up to 0.76 m in length
- during embryonic development, a large muscle fiber is formed from the fusing of smaller cells called **myoblasts** => multinuciated
- lots of mitochondria

###### Structure

- whole muscle -> muscle fiber (cell) -> myofibril -> thick and thin filaments -> myosin and actin
- bundled **myofibrils**: special contractile elements that make up 80% of the volume of the muscle fiber
	- ~1 micron in diameter
	- extend entire length of fiber
	- consist of regular arrangments of **thick filaments** (12-18 nm in diameter, 1.6 microns in length) and **thin filaments** (5-8 nm in diameter, 1.0 microns in length)
- **thick filaments**: assemblages of **myosin**
- **thin filaments**: made primarily of **actin** protein
- muscle is covered in a dense connective tissue made of **collagen** and to a lesser extent **elastin**
	- **epimysium:** covers whole muscle
	- **perimysium:** divides muscles fibers in to bundles called **fascicles**
	- **endomysium:** innermost connective tissue which covers each muscle fiber
- contractile force -> connective tissue sheets -> **tendon** -> bone
- When looking at a fiber there are a series of bands that produce the striated apperance:
	- **dark bands: A bands**
	- **light bands: I bands**
