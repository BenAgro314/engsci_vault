### 2.14 Synapses and Neuronal Integration (73-)

Neurons may **innervate** glands, muscles or another neuron.

**Synapse:** junction between any two excitable cells. 

**Neuronal synapse:** junctino between **presynaptic neuron** and **postsynaptic neuron**. 

**Axon terminal** of presynaptic neuron forms **synaptic knob** which contains **synaptic vesicles** of **neurotransmitter**. There is a gap between the synaptic knob and the dendrites called the **synaptic cleft**. 

##### Electrical Synapses

These take the form of gap junctions between neurons. They allow for communication without synaptic delay, they are **bidirectional**, **excitatory only**, and the can be between neurons or neuron - glial cell (**astrocytes**).

##### Steps for neurotransmitter signalling

1. AP is propogated to synaptic knob, VG Ca2+ channels open, allowing Ca2+ influx
2. Ca2+ influx induces exocytosis of the synpatic vesicles, releasing NT into the synaptic cleft. A 1-2 ms delay occurs between the AP arrival and the NT release called the *total reaction time*.
3. NT binds to receptors on the **subsynaptic membrane**
4. This binding triggers the opening of specific chemically gated ion channels that generate graded potentials. **Excitatory post synaptic potentials (EPSPs)** are triggered by the opening of general cation channels (more Na+ in than K+ out due to electrochemical gradient), Na+ channels, or Ca2+ channels. **Inhibitory post synaptic potentials (IPSPs)** are triggered by the opening of K+ channels (hyperpolarization) or Cl- channels (maintance of RMP). Sometimes cells have a higher concentration of Cl- in the ECF, resulting in slight hyperpolarization.

**Dale's law:** a semi-defunct theory that each neuron only releases one type of neurotransmitter. A neuron may release **neuroactive peptides** along with a **neurotransmitter**. 

**Most common excitatory NTs** are ACh and glutamate. **Most common inhibitory NTs** are GABA and glycine. 

However, for the puposes of this course we assume that **generally each neuron releases only one neurotransmitter at a particular synapse**. 

**The response betwen a given neurotransmitter-receptor combination** is constant. Recent evidence suggests that a single axon terminal may be able to release two neurotransmitters at once (like GABA and glycine). 

##### Neurotransmitter removal

1. diffusion away from the synaptic cleft
2. enzymatic inactivation (eg. acetylcholinesterase turns ACh in to choline).
3. active transport back into the synaptic terminal (eg. NE) or a glial cell. 

##### Grand postsynaptic potential (GPSP)

The **GPSP** is the result of the summation of all of the **EPSPs** and **IPSPs** in a post synaptic neuron. If the GPSP reaches threshold, an AP will be generated. 

1. **Temporal summation:** 	summation of several EPSPs or IPSPs occuring close in time from a single presynaptic neuron.
2. **Spatial summation:** summation of EPSPs an IPSPs at a single time coming from multiple presynaptic neurons. 

##### Postsynaptic neuronal integration

**Postsynaptic neuronal integration** of EPSPs and IPSPs is vital for precise control over effectors based on multiple competing or reinforcing stimuli. 

Eg. urination: summation of EPSPs from stretch reflex signal from bladder and voluntary IPSPs to prevent inopportune urination. Temporal summation of bladder signal can cause contraction. Cancellation of EPSPs and IPSPs (spatial) can prevent contraction. Spatial summation of EPSPs can cause voluntary contraction. 

**Dendrites** recieve and tally signals. These are conducted to the trigger zone where there are summated and the GPSP dictates if threshold is reached. Neuronal integration allows **information filtering**, and each neuron can act as a **computational unit** or **integrating center**. It allows for **noise to be filtered out**. If every presynaptic neuron could cause an action potential, the postsynaptic neuron would be filled with trivial signals. 

##### Neuropeptides as Neuromodulators

**Neuropeptides** are larger molecules (2-40 amino acids) that are stored in **dense core vesicles** in the axon terminal. They are belived to function as **neuromodulators**, which modulate the action at the synpase. They
- do not directly alter membrane permiability or potential
- may either act on presynaptic or postsynaptic neurons (**non-synaptic sites**)
	- eg. influence level of enzyme activity in pre-synaptic neuron that synthesizes neurotransmitter. 
	- eg. alter sensitivity of postsynaptic neuron to a particular neurotransmitter by causing long-term changes to the number of subsynaptic receptor sites. 
- they are synthesized in the ER and golgi complex in the cell body and transported to the axon terminal (unlike NTs which are synthesized in the cytosol of the synaptic knob)

**Examples:** ACh, dopamine, serotonin, NE

##### Presynaptic Inhibition or Facilitation

**Presynaptic modulation** is when a third neuron synapses on the pre-synaptic neuron and either inhibits or facilitates the exocytosis of NTs when it is stimulated. This auxillary neuron will control how much Ca2+ enters the presynaptic neuron. 

This increases the **specificty of control**, because one neurons EPSPs or IPSPs can be "turned off". This contrasts postsynaptic inhibition/facilitation, where an EPSP or IPSP is nessecarily summed with the EPSPs and IPSPs from all other presynaptic neurons. 

For example, consider two presynaptic neurons A (excitatory) and B (inhibitory), and a third neuron C that presynaptically inhibits A. If C and A fire simulatenously, no ESPS will be generated due to presynaptic inhibition. If B and A fire simulatneously, no EPSP will be generated due to postsynaptic inhibition. However, the firing of B will not only cancel out the EPSP of A, but also the EPSP of other neurons synapsing on the same postsynaptic neuron. 

**Presynaptic inhibition is selective:** it can inhibit one presynaptic input without inhibiting any others.

##### Drugs, diseases and transmission

**Possible drug actions:**
1. alter synthesis, axonal transport, storage, or release of a NT
2. modify NT interaction with post synaptic receptor
3. infulence NT reuptake or destruction
4. replace a deficient NT with a substitute

**Tolerance** refers to a desinsitization to an addictive drug caused by long term postsynaptic changes (such as the number of receptors). Eg. cocaine blocks re-uptake of the NT **dopamine**, so it remains in the synaptic cleft for longer. 

**Parkinsons disease (PD)** is characterized by a deficiency in dopamine in the **basal nuclei**, which is responsible for the control of slow movements and reducing unessecary movement patterns. This results in involuntary tremors and muscular rigidity. 

**Tetanus Toxin** prevents the release of an inibitory NT GABA and blocks the inhibitory presynaptic inputs to skeletal muscles. This causes muscle spasms that often result in the symptom of **lockjaw**. 

**Neuronal convergance** is when a single neuron has many presynaptic inputs (very common).

**Neuronal divergance** is when the axon of a single neuron branches and terminates on many different cells (less common). This often occurs in the form of **varicosities** in the autonomic nervous system. 

##### Lab 2 Review: Hodgkin-Huxley AP model

**Increased injected current** increases the frequency of action potential firing (makes sense, it is like a more intense stimulus).

**With a sustained current that is too large**, only one AP will occur, with none afterwards. The current is so large that after depolarization, the K+ influx is not enough to repolarize the neuron to a resting state, preventing another AP. 

**There is no current that can be injected to cause a half-height AP** because APs are **all or nothing**.

There is a **logarithmic relationship** between the threshold current and the pulse duration. A larger pulse duration corresponds to a lower threshold for initiating an AP. **The area under the current time plot** must be considered when evaluating if threshold will be reached.

**Reducing the conductance of Na+** is like **decreasing the permeablity to Na+** which hyperpolarizes the neuron, so a larger stimulus (current) is required to reach threshold. 

**Kidneys secrete about 1.5 L/day = 62.5 ml/hour of water.**

**Too much water in the ECF** => reduced Na+ concentration gradient => lower equillibrium potential for Na+ => lower RMP => greater stimulus required to reach threshold. Also, there is less of a driving force for Na+ to enter the ICF, so the AP peak will be lower. 

If the ECF concentration of Na+ is lower than the ICF concentration, and single AP may be generated, with none afterwards. While the concentration gradient is reversed, the electrical gradient still forces some Na+ into the cell. 

Some drugs called **Nav inhibitors** act to increase Na+ conductivity, and can be used to treat conditions of low ECF Na+ concentration. 

**Reduced conductance (permeability) to K+** causes a less negative RMP and thus APs are easier to generate (seizures).

Too high K+ concentration in the ECF (or reduced K+ permeability) => less negative RMP => hyperexcitability of membrane.
