# Week 2

**Textbook sections:**  2.1, 2.2, 2.4-2.8

##### Cell theory 

All cells arise from prexisting cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure and function. All living substance is localized in cells. Multicellular organisms are aggregates of cells. 

##### Thermoregulation

**Hypothermia:** body temp < 35 C
**Hyperthermia:** harder to define an exact point

Temperature moderates rate of enzymatic activity and enzyme shape. 

**Pyrexia:** fever, improves immune function. 

**Body is too hot:**
- behavioral change
- vasodilation (precapillar sphincter relaxes)
- sweating (evaporation)
- ensure that body fluids are maintained to avoid **dehydration**: low blood pressure, delerium, heat stroke.

**Body is too cold:**
- behavioral change
- vasoconstriction
- increased muscle tone 
- shivering 
- non-shivering thermogensis (release of thyroid hormone increase metabolism rate)


**Sequence of a pyrexia:**

1. Bacteria release **pyrogens**, inducing white cells to release **cytokines**.
2. Hypothalmus releases **prostaglandins**. 
3. Increased set point, body temp follows slower, inducing a state of **rigor** (feel cold).
4. Reduced set point, body temp starts to fall (**crisis point**), feel hot.

### 2.1 Observation of Cells (22)

Microscopes are required to observe cells. The bilayer appears "trilaminar" under an microscope. 

### 2.2 Overview of Cell Structure (22)

200 different cell types. 

##### Organelles 

|Cell part|Structure|Function|
---|---|---|
**Plasma Membrane**| lipid bilayer studded with proteins and carbs (fluid mosaic) | Selective barrier. 
**Nucelus**| DNA enclosed by a double membrane | control centre of cell|
**Cytoplasm**|
*Organelles*|
ER| Membrane of RER is continuous with nucleus and has embedded ribosomes. | RER synthesizes (really the ribosomes do) and packages proteins for the golgi-complex and SER synthesizes lipids, fatty acids, phospholipids, and steroids |
Golgi Complex | Flattend membrane sacs | modifies, packages, and distributes products for export | 
Lysosomes| sacs of hydrolytic enzymes | digestion of foreign elements and cell debris |
Centriole| barrell-shaped | site of growth for microtubules 
Peroxisomes| membrane sacs with oxidative enzymes | detoxification (H2O2)|
Mitochondria| double-membraned oval shape with internal folds called cristae | site of TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation |
Vaults| octogonal barrels | cellular transport trucks | 
*Cysosol*|
Ribosomes| RNA and proteins, some attached to RER, some in cytosol | protein synthesis |
Vesicles | membrane enclosed cell products | transport, export and import |
Inclusions | glycogen and fat granules/droplets | store excess nutrients |
*Cytoskeleton* |
Microtubules | slender hollow tubes | maintain cell shape, coordinate cell movements, cellular highways, cilia and flagella, miotic spindle during cell division. 
Microfilaments | helical chains | contractile mechanisms 
Intermediate Filaments | threadlike proteins | resistance of mechanical stress 

##### Transport of vesicles down microtubules
- the centrioles form microtubules, which are made of **tubulin proteins**
- microtubules radiate away from centrioles with their plus end far away and minus end at the centriole
- Motor molecules attach to, and move along, the microtubules
- kinesin can only move towards plus end
- dynein can only move towards the minus end 

**Organelle expression varies between cells:**

Pancratic exocrine cells create insulin and other proteins, so they have lots of RER. Liver hepatocyte play roles in metabolism and detoxification, hence they have lysosomes, peroxisomes, and lots of mitochondria. 

### 2.3 Cellular Metabolism (22-28)

**Intermediary Metabolism:** set of chemical reactions that involve the degredation, synthesis, and transformation of molecules. 

**Anabolic:** build up.
**Catabolic:** break down

**ATP:**
$$ ATP \to ADP + P_i + \text{energy}$$

##### Sustrate Level Phosphorylation

$$ X-P + ADP \to ATP $$

Example: **creatine phosphate** has its phosphate removed by **creatine kinase** and it is used to create and ATP molecule. 

Rapid action (eg. in skeletal muscles)

##### Glycolsis

Occurs in cytosol. Requires 2 ATP to produce 4: **Net 2 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 3C pyruvate per glucose molecule**

If anerobic: pyruvate is turned in to lactic acid, which consumes the 2 NADH that were generated  (**lactic acid fermentation**). Otherwise, the pyruvate is moved into the mitochondria to undergo the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.


##### Pyruvate Decarboxylation

Pyruvate is turned into acetyl-CoA by an enyzme as it moves into the mitochondria. This forms a CO2 molecule per pyruvate. 1 NADH is also created per pyruvate.

##### TCA cycle

Occurs in mitochondrial matrix

per glucose (2 acetyl-CoA):
- 6 NADH
- 2 FADH
- 2 GTP -> 2 ATP

##### Electron Transport Chain (ETC)

Energy from electron carriers NADH and FADH is used to pump H+ ions from the mitochondrial matrix into the inter-membrane space. These then flow down their concetration gradient through **ATP synthase** to make ATP. 

Produces a maximum of **34 ATP** per glucose molecule. 

Protein channels are on inner membrane of mitochondria. 

### 2.4 The Plasma Membrane (28-33)

Appears **trilaminar** under and **electron microscope**. 

**Phospholipids:** Polar (hydrophilic) choline + phosphate + glycerol head and two non-polar (hydrophobic) tails. 

Phospholipids self assemble into a **lipid bilayer**. 
1. forms basic structure
2. barrier to the passage of water soluble substances 
3. responsible for membrane fluidity 

**Cholersterol** contributes to membrane fluidity be preventing the phospholipids from crystallizing. It also helps to stablize the phospholipids. 

**Membrane proteins** are inserted in or attached to the lipid bilayer => fluid mosaic model.

##### Types of membrane components

1. membrane spanning channels for small ion passage. can be selective for certain ions.
2. carrier molecules which transport substances across the membrane via a conformational change. 
3. docking marking acceptors: bind to the docking markers on seceratory vesicles.
4. membrane bound enzymes: allow for more specialized functions.
5. receptors: initiate secondary messenging pathways in the cell or change membrane permiability. Each cell may respond differently to a give molecules. 
6. **Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs)** form hooks and loops for cells to grasp one another and connective tissues. **Cadherins** form zipper like connections between cells. **Integrins** span the plasma membrane and form a mechanical link between cytoskeleton and surroundings for structure and communication. 
7.  self regcognition via glycoproteins and glyolipids. 

**Glycolipids and glycoproteins** consist of proteins and lipids that are "sugarcoated" with carbohydrates. 

**Lipids are dynamic:**
- $\sim 10^6$ exchanges with neighbours per second 
- diffuse several microns per second 
- Flippase enzymes move phosphlipids from one leaflet to the other
- can rotate, laterally shift, and "flip flop" between leaflets. 

### 2.5 Cell-Cell Adhesions (33-36)

##### Cellular glue

1. **Collagen**: cable like fibers for tensile strength.
2. **Elastin**: rubber like protein that provides flexability and recoilability (eg. lungs).
3. **fibronectin**: promotes cell adhesion and holds cells in position. Reduced in cancerous tissues (they tend to break loose). 

**Fibroblasts** secrete and abundance of this matrix. 

##### Cell Junctions

- **Desmosomes**: adhering structural junctions. Abundent in stretching tissues like heart, skin and uterus. 
	1. plaque (cytoplasmic thickening) on adjacent cells with intracellular **keratin** support. 
	2. strong glyoprotein filaments containing cadherins connect to both plaques 
- **Tight Junctions**: seals off passageway between cells. Used by epithelial cells 
	- strands of junctional proteins meet at "kiss sites". 
	- materials must pass through cells, not between them
- **Gap Junction**: small ions can pass through the connexons that make up this junction for cell-cell communication. 
	- connexons are made of 6 protein subunits 
	- abundent in cardiac and smooth muscle 

### 2.6 Overview of Membrane Transport (36-37)

##### Factors affecting permeability
1. relative solubility of the particle in lipid
2. size of the particle 

small (<0.8 nm diameter) polar molecules may pass through transport proteins. 

### 2.7 Unassisted Membrane Transport (37-41)

**Passive diffusion:** occurs down concentration (or electrochmical - for ions) gradient.

**Rate of diffusion** scales like $\sim \frac{1}{L^2}$ where $L$ is the length scale. 

**Osmosis:** diffusion of water down its concentration gradient (against the solute concentration gradient).

**Aquaporin** channels permit the passage of water through the cell membrane. 

**Tonicity:** the affect the surrounding solution has on cell volume. 

**Hypertonic:** higher solute concentration
**Hypotonic:** lower solute concentration 
**Isotonic:** Same solute concentration 

**Unequal penetrating solute concentrations:** no net volume change. Both osmosis and diffusion occur.

**Unequal non-penetrating solute concentrations:** water moves to high-solute concentration side, increase of volume on the initially hypertonic side. 

**Pure water vs non-penetrating solute:** water moves to hypertonic side unit osmotic pressure equals hydrostatic pressure.

### 2.8 Assisted Membrane Transport (41-51)

[Transport Diagram](Transport.html)

**Characteristics:**
- **Specificity:** what type of molecules does the protein transport. Carriers may be **stereospecific** or may bind multiple molecules. 
- **Saturation:** Limited number of receptor sites mean that the carriers can become saturated, so a higher concentration will not increase the rate of transport.
- **Competitiion:** two molecules may compete for receptor sites on a single transporter, meaning that both will be transported at a slower rate. 

**Facilitated diffusion:** carrier molecules and channels allow for the movement of otherwise impermeable molecules down their concentration gradients. Eg. transport of glucose into cells. Facilitated diffusion will plateau at a certain solute concentration due to saturation. 

**Uniporter:** transports one molecule in one direction.
**Cotransport:**
- **Symporter:** transports two molecules in the same direction.
- **Antiporter:** transports two molecules in opposite directions.

**Some examples from week 4 case study:**
- *erythrocyte anion exchange protein:* facilitates exchange of bicarbonate ions for chloride ions. Antiporter: Cl in, HCO3 out.
- *KCC2 (potassion-cholride cotransporter 2):* symporter found on the neurons in the nervous system. Uses K+ electrochemical gradient to move Cl- out of the cell. 

**Active transport:** use ATP to move a molecule against its electrochemical gradient. 

**Some examples from the week 4 case study:**
- *P-type ATPases:* pumps that become phosphorylated to transport cations eg. Na-K ATPase pump.
- *V-type ATPases:* escicle pumps that force protons into organelles such as vacuoles, endosomes, and golgi complex.
- *F-type ATPases:* similar to V-type, move protons across a membrane, composed of a transmembrane compoenet and a peripheral ATPase component. Found in mitochondria. Reversible. 
- *ABC-type ATPases:* **A**TP **b**inding **c**assette. Consist of four protein subunits.  


##### Na-K ATPase pump
- high affinity for K+ when phosphorylated, high affinity for Na+ when not phosphorylated
1. 3 Na+ bind on ICF side, allowing the pump to split ATP. 
2. ATP is split and P sticks to pump. 
3. Conformational change causes pump to flip to face ECF, 3 Na+ are released (lower affinity now, high affinity for K+)
4. 2 K+ bind to high affinity sites, allowing the pump to release P. 
5. Phosphate group is released upon binding of K+, and pump flips inwards. 
6. low affinity for K+ -> K+ is released into cell. 

**Secondary Active Transport:** Uses energy stored in an electrochemical gradient to transport another molecule against its concentration gradient via co-transport. Eg. Transport of glucose from lumen into epithelian cell via the Na+ gradient. This is done via the SGLT symporter. More Na+ binds on the extracelluar side than the intracellular side. Na+ changes the carriers affinity for glucose. The Na-K ATPase pump moves Na+ from the ICF to the blood through the basolateral membrane to maintain a low intracellular concentration of Na+. Glucose is then transported by a carrier called GLUT via faciliated diffusion from the intenstinal cell to the blood. 

**Endocytosis:** membrane engulfs extracellular material. **Pinocytosis** is non-specific cell drinking, englufing water and solute molecules. **Receptor mediated endocytosis** requires specific target molecules to bind to receptors (clatherin coated pits). **Phagocytosis** occurs in specialized cells which create pseudopods that surround their prey. 

**Dynamin** is the protein respondible for "wringing the neck" of the endocytotic vesicle. 

Lysosomes are often used to degrade the contents of an endocytotics vesicle. 

**Exocytosis** releases contents via exocytotic vesicles. It can also be used to add contents to the membrane. 

##### Steps of secretion from the glogi apparatus

1. sorting signals from the newly synthesized product bind to **recognition markers** causing the membrane to wrap around the vesicle using the **coatomer** protein that causes the membrane to curve.
2. Membrane pinches off from golgi
3. vesicle loses coatomer, exposing v-SNARE **docking markers**
4. v-SNARE bind to corresponding t-SNARE **docking marking acceptors**, triggering exocytosis. 


##### Polypeptide steps

1. RER synthesizes proteins
2. make their way to SER where they are packaged in transport vesicles that travel to the golgi
3. golgi may modify contents, and then it performs the steps outlined above to create and export a seceratory vesicle
