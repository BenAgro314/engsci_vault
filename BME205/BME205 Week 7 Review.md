# Week 7

**Textbook sections:** 4.1-4.3, 4.9-4.11

### 4.1 Peripheral Nervous System (141)

- serves as link between the periphery and the central nervous system
- concious control: **somatic nervous system**
- unconcious control: **autonomic nervous system**
	- fight or flight: **sympathetic**
	- rest and digest: **parasympathetic**
	- **enteric nervous system:** influences pancreas, liver, gall bladder, **controls gastrointestinal motility, secretion, and blood flow**

### 4.2 Afferent Division (142-143)

- cell bodies of afferent (sensory neurons) aggregated in the **dorsal root ganglion**
- four main types of receptors 
	1. mechanoreceptors: stretch, sound waves, blood pressure, acceleration.
	2. thermoreceptors: heat
	3. chemoreceptors: smell, taste, content of digestive tract, O2 and CO2 in the blood. 
	4. photoreceptors: visible wavelengths of light
- Types of sensations
	1. **viseral afferent:** from organs in the body cavities 
	2. **sensory afferent**
		- **somatic sensation:** body sense (somaesthetic sensation and proprioception)
		- **special senses:** vision, hearing, taste, smell, equillibrium
- **perception** is the concious interpretation of the external world. It is not an accurate representation of reality. 

### 4.3 Receptor Physiology (143-148)

- **somatosensory receptors:** a specialized nerve ending with an exposed receptor
- **special senses receptor:** turn special sense stimuli into neural stimuli by synapsing with an afferent neuron. This process of turning one form of energy to another is called **transduction**
- An **adequate stimulus** refers to the type of stimulus (energy) a receptor is specialized to respond to.
- the perception of sensation depends on the receptor's **modality** rather than the type of stimulus (ie seeing stars when punched in the eyes)
- The minimum stimulus required to activate a receptor is known as a the **threshold**
- Uses of sensory information:
	- control of efferent output 
	- RAS is critical for cortical arousal and conciousness
	- perception of the world 
	- stored for future referance (memory)
	- emotion
- graded potentials in specialized neuron endings are called **generator potentials**
	- if of sufficient magnitude (GPSP > threshold), and action potential may be generated
- graded potentials in specialized receptor cells are called **receptor potentials**. 
	1. if receptor potentials are of a sufficent magnitude, VG Ca2+ channels will open causing exocytosis of a neurotransmitter which will cause and graded potential in the neuron. 
- unlike efferent neurons or interneurons, the action potentials are initiated at peripheral neuron end, not the axon hillock. 
- intensity is reflected in magnitude of receptor (or generator) potential, which is translated into frequency of action potentials. 

##### Adaptation to sustained stimulation

- some receptors diminish the extent of their depolarization despite sustained stimulus strength: **adaptation**
- **tonic receptors**:
	- to not adapt at all or adapt slowly
	- important when continual information about the stimulus is nessecary
	- eg. muscle stretch receptors, joint proprioceptors, pain
- **Phasic receptors**
	- rapidly adapting
	- has an **off response** when the stimulus is removed
	- usefull when it is important to signal a change in stimulus intensity rather than relaying status quo information 
	- eg. touch receptors

##### Labelled lines and stimulus location

- pathways conveying **somaesthetic** information to the brain consist of discrete chains of neurons called **labelled lines** that move up the ascending tracts. 
- one type of nerve only carries one sensation modality
- see [[BME205 Week 5 Review#Grey and White Matter]] for more on neuronal order
- a specific modality from a specialized receptor is sent over a specific afferent pathway (the one commited to that modality) to excite a defined area of the somatosensory	 cortex. 
- **Stimulus type (modality)** -> distiguished by receptor type (and thus pathway)
- **Stimulus location** -> distingushed by location of activated receptive field and the subsequently activated pathway (location on cortex)
- **Stimulus intensity** -> frequency of action potentials

##### Acuity

- **receptive field:** area which a somatosensory neuron responds to stimulus
- size of receptive field varies inversely with receptor density in the region
- smaller receptive field -> greater **acuity (discriminative ability)** 
- acuity is also enhanced by **lateral inhibition**
	- to facilitate precise localization
	- most strongly activated pathway inhibits the less activated ones via inhibitory interneurons that pass lateral to the ascending fibers of neighbouring receptive field.
	- increased contrast between strong and weak stimuli increases localization acuity

##### Mechanoreceptors

|Name|Adaptation Type|Structre/Function|
|---|---|---|
|Pachinian Corpuscle| phasic | onion layers of connective tissue, touch and deep pressure, sensitive to viration, 250 Hz, 200 micrometer textures. Receptor layers slip as adaptation occurs|
|Meissner's Corpuscle| phasic | tactile, myelinated neuron endings, sensing light touch, 50 Hz, 3-5 mm receptive field, nerve ending encapsulated in connective tissue|
|Merkel's discs | tonic | 5-15 Hz (lowest frequency), myelinated neuron ending, superficial skin layers |
| Ruffini Corpuscle | tonic | myelinated neuron endings, deep layers of skin (subcutaneous tissues and joints), stretch and torque and continuous pressure |
| Free nerve endings | 	tonic | temperature and noicioception (pain), either myelinated or unmyelinated |

### 4.9 Autonomic  Nervous System (187-193)

- innervates smooth and cardianc muscle and glands

![[Pasted image 20210227193114.png]]
![[Pasted image 20210227202225.png]]

- **Parasympathetic**
	- **preganglionic fibers**
		- relatively long
		- synapse on **terminal ganglia**
		- lightly myelinated
		- originate from cranium (brain stem) and sarcal regions
		- release acetylcholine (ACh) (**cholinergic fibers**)
	- **postganglionic fibers**
		- have **nicotinic receptors** on their dendrites/cell bodies
		- release ACh to **muscarinic receptors**
- **Sympathetic**
	- **preganglionic fibers**
		- secrete ACh (cholinergic fibers)
		- are relatively short
		- usually synapse on a sympathetic ganglion chain
		- originate from the thoracic and lumbar spine
		- some terminate on a modified ganglion called the **adrenal medulla** which is housed in the **adrenal gland** and releases norepinephrine (NE ~ 20%) and epinephrine (E ~ 80%) into the blood
		- lightly myelinated
		- some synapse later on **collateral ganglia**
	- **postganglionic fibers**
		- have **nicotinic receptors** on their dendrites/cell bodies
		- secrete NE (**adrenergic fibers**)

Postganglionic fibers in both divisions end in numerous axonal swellings called **varicosities** that allow for one neuron to release neurotransmitter to many target cells simultaneously. (affect whole organs instead of discrete cells)

- the level of ongoing activity from one of the two divisions is called the (sympathetic or parasympathetic) **tone** or **tonic activity**

##### Advantages of dual innervation

- **antagonistic control** is more precise.
- (unopposed control is called **tonic control**)
- the two systems need to be **reciprocally controlled** (increase in one and decrease in the other)
- increased homeostatic control	
- eg. sympathetic -> radial muscle of iris contracts, causing dilation, parasympathetic -> circular muscle of the iris contracts (maintance under bright light)
- **exceptions:**
	1. blood vessels recieve only sympathetic fibers (except for penis and clitoris)
	2. sweat glands are only innervated by sympathetic nerves (weirdly they secrete NE not ACh)
	3. salivary glands are excited by both division, although the composition differs. 

##### Receptor Types

- **Cholinergic receptors**: bind ACh
	- **nicotinic receptors**
		- postganglionic cell bodies
		- NMJ
		- agonist is nicotine
		- open cation channel for K+ and Na+
		- Curare is an antagonist
	- **muscarinic receptors**
		- innervated organs in the parasympathetic nervous system
		- G-protein second messenger system
- **Adrenergic Receptors:** bind NE or E
	- **alpha 1**
		- excitatory
		- prefers NE
		- Ca2+ second messenger system
		- sympathetic nervous system
	- **alpha 2**
		- inhibitory 
		- reduction of cAMP second messenger
		- prefers NE
	- **Beta 1**
		- excitatory
		- NE and E are equal
		- cardiac muscle
		- cAMP second messenger
	- **Beta 2**
		- inhibitory 
		- cAMP second messenger
		- prefers E
	- **Beta 3**
		- less common
		- stimulated by sympathetic nervous system to break down fat (along with alpha 2)

##### Agonists and Antagonists 

- **Agonists** bind to the same receptor and elicit a mimicing effect
- **Antagonists** competitively inhibit the action of a neurotransmitter (or any first messenger)
	- **atrophine** blocks the effect of ACh at muscarinic receptors
	- **Salbutamol** selectively activates Beta 2 receptors (dilation of bronchiles during asthma treatment)

##### Control of autonomic activities 

1. spinal cord controls reflexes: urination, defecation, erection 
2. medula is responsible for autonomic output: cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive
3. hypothalamus integrates autonomic, somatic and endocrine responses that accompany emotional states
4. prefrontal association cortex can also influence autonomic output 

### 4.10 Somatic Nervous System (193-196)

- **motor neurons** innervate skeletal muscle and are the **final common pathway**
	- many convering presynaptic inputs to a motor neuron
	- the only way the nervous system can influence the skeletal muscles is through the motor neurons
	- balance of EPSPs and IPSPS -> GPSP dictate skeletal muscle response
	- much of the skeletal activity is subconciously controlled: posture, balance, walking ect.
	- **poliovirus** destroys cell bodies of motor neurons. 
	- **ALS** changes neuronal filaments that are crucial for axonal transport, toxic levels of glutamate in the ECF, misfolded intracellular proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction leading to reduced energy production.

### 4.11 Neuromuscular Junction (196-)

- **neuromusclar junction (NMJ)** is the site of the 1-1 interaction of the axon terminal and a muscle cell (fiber)
- axon enlarges into a terminal button that synpases with the **motor end plate**, a specialzed portion of the muscle cell membrane
1. An AP is propogated down the myelinated axon. As the axon diverges, it loses its myelination. Once this AP reaches the terminal button, votage gated Ca2+ channels open and there is an influx of Ca2+
2. This causes exocytosis of ACh 
3. ACh diffuses across the cleft and binds with **nicotinic** receptors on the motor end plate
4. This causes K+ efflux and Na+ influx, resulting in an EPSP called an **end plate potential (EPP)**. 
5. Local current flow in the muscle cell causes VG Na+ opening in the adjacent membrane. 
6. This brings the muscle cell to threshold, and the AP is propogated throughout the muscle.
7. ACh is turned into choline by acetylcholinesterase which is an enzyme on the motor end plate, and it is taken back up by the terminal button for recycling. 
- A single axon terminal cause cause an action potential (unlike in most neurons) because more ACh is released and there are more receptors that normal on the motor end plate. 
- usually a 1-1 correspondance between neuronal action potentials and muscle action potentials (EPPs are large enough)
- ACh rapidly binds and unbinds with receptors, and gradually more will become deacitvated by AChE. 
- binding take ~1 microsecond, generally deactivated ~ 1 ms post release

##### Toxins

- **Blackwidow venom:** explosive release of ACh causes **depolarization block**
- **Botulism Toxin:** block release of ACh 
- **Curare:** blocks action of ACh at receptor sites (antagonist)
- **Organophosphates:** irreversibly inhibit AChE preventing the inhibition of ACh
- **Myasthenia Gravis:** immune disorder that attacks receptors on motor end plate. Administer a drug like **neostigmine** that temporarily inhibits AChE.
