**Textbook sections:** 3.1 - 3.7

### Organization of the Nervous System (92-93)

The nevous system has two main divisions that continue downards in a tree like structure:
1. **CNS**
	- brain
	- spinal cord
2. **PNS**
	- afferent division
		- sensory stimuli
		- viseral stimuli
	- efferent division
		- somatic 
			- motor neurons 
				- skeletal muscles
		- autonomic (both divisions innvervate smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, exocrine glands, and some endrocrine glands)
			- sympathetic
			- parasympathetic 

##### Classes of Neurons

- **afferent neurons**
	- **unipolar**
	- **long** peripheral axon (**afferent fiber**)
	- **short central axon** from the cell body to the spinal cord (**proximal end**)
	- **sensory receptor** or synapse with specialzed receptor at distal end
	- synapse with interneuron in the spinal cord
	- cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglion
	- travel up the dorsal root with synapses in the dorsal horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord
- **efferent neurons**
	- cell bodies in the CNS (ventral horn of the grey matter of the spinal cord)
	- multipolar
	- efferent fibers travel out of the CNS to muscles, glands, or ganglia
- **interneurons**
	- about 99% of neurons are interneurons
	- ~100 billion interneurons in the CNS
	- usually bipolar
	- connect afferent and efferent neurons 

### 3.2 Structure and Function of the Central Nervous System (93-95)

##### Functions of the central nervous system

1. Emotions
2. Regulation of the internal environement
3. Thoughts and conciousness
4. high cognition like thoughts and memory
5. concious awarness (perception) of the external environment and body 

##### Parts of the brain (from top to bottom)

- Cerebrum (~80% of total brain mass)
	- cerebral cortex
		1. sensory **perception**
		2. voluntary motor control
		3. language 
		4. personality
		5. sophisticated mental events: conciousness, thinking, memory, decision making
	- basal nuclei
		1. control of slow movements 
		2. reduction of irrelevant movement patterns
		3. inhibition of muscle tone
- Diencephalon
	- thalamus
		1. sensory relay center
		2. crude awareness of sensation
		3. some degree of conciousness 
		4. role in motor control
		5. along with the brain stem, contains the **reticular formation**, which sends signal to the cerbral cortex through the **reticular activating system**, which plays a role in **cortical alterness**. 
	- hypothalamus (homeostatic control center)
		1. emotional regulation
		2. temperature
		3. urination and thirst

	3. planning of skilled motor activity (**motor plan**)
- brain stem 
	1. origin of majority of cranial nerves
	2. cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive control center
	3. muscle reflexes for posture and equillibrium
	4. reception of all synaptic input from the spinal cord.
	5. **reticular formation** plays a role in cortical alterness
	6. role in sleep-wake cycle

### 3.3 Protection of The CNS (95-100)

90 percent of the cells in the CNS are **glial cells**, however they only occupy half of the brain volume because they do not branch as much as neurons do.

**Glial cells** serve as connective tissue for the CNS, supporting neurons metabolically and physically. 

##### Astrocytes 

1. physically support neurons with their podocytes (maintain spatial relationships)
2. assist in **neural scar formation** after injury and repair of brain injuries
3. act as scaffolding during fetal brain development
4. guide and induce the capillaries to form the **blood brain barrier** (BBB)
5. take up excess K+ from the ECF during periods of high neuronal activity
6. take up and degrade neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate
7. enhance synpase formation. 
	- They can communicate with neurons and themselves with gap junctions.
	- they have receptors for some neurotransmitters like glutamate 
	- They can also communicate via **K+ wave propogation**: astrocytes respond to glutamate or ATP released by neurons, causing K+ influx into the cell. This intracellular rise in K+ prompts the astrocyte to release ATP, activating adjacent glial cells. 
	- they can release other neurotransmitters, similar to neurons

##### Oligodendrocytes

Create the myelin sheaths around neurons in the CNS. 

##### Microglia

- immune cells of the CNS
- at rest, they release *nerve growth factor* which helps neurons and other glial cells thrive and survive
- if there is a foreign invader in the CNS, the microglia retract their branches and release descructive enzymes on their target (they are **phagocytic**)

##### Ependymal cells

- line the fluid cavities of the CNS (ventricals and spinal cord)
- **ventricals:** four interconnected chambers in the brain. 
- **central canal:** fluid filled tunnel that travels down the middle of the spinal cord.
- help form the cerebrospinal fluid (the **choroid plexus** secretes new CSF and consists of modified ependymal cells surrounding a core of cappilaries and connective tissue)
- bear **cilia** which beat (via the protein **dynein**) to move CSF through the ventricles.
- may act as **neural stem cells** with the potential to form new neurons

**Meniginomas** are tumors of glial cells that originate in the brain (neurons themselves cannot cause tumors because they cannot divide).

##### Protection of the nervous tissue

- hard bone (the **cranium** and **vertebral column**)
- three protective layers known as the **meningies**
- brain floats on the **CSF**, which acts a cushion
- **BBB** limits access of blood-borne materials into the vunerable brain tissues

##### Meningieal Membranes

1. **Dura mater**
	- tough outermost layer 
	- inelastic
	- somtimes seperates from arachnoid mater to form **dural sinuses** or (in the case of larger cavities) **venous sinuses**
	- venous blood draining from the brain and CSF returns to the blood stream through these sinuses. 
2. **Arachnoid Mater**
	- cobweb appearance
	- richly vascularized
	- space between arachnoid mater and pia mater forms the subarachnoid space which is filled with CSF
	- **Arachnoid Vili** penetrate through gaps in the overlyind dura mater to return CSF back to the blood circulating the in sinuses 
3. **Pia mater**
	- most fragile layer
	- highly vascular
	- adheres directly to brain and spinal cord
	- dips down brain folds to bring a rich blood supply in close contact with the ependymal cells lining the ventricals. 

##### CSF

- surrounds and cushions the brain
- same density as brain, neutral buoyancy 
- major function is to serve a shock absorber
- NOT brain intersitial fluid, but the brain intersitial fluid is heaviy influenced by the composition of the CSF
- formed by the **choroid plexus**
	- vascular pia matter dips into pockets of ependymal cells
- composition of CSF is lower in K+ and higher in Na+ to promote neuronal activity. 

##### Flow of CSF

1. formed by choroid plexus (there a multiple in different ventricles)
2. circulates through ventricles
3. exits fourth ventricle at the base of the brain
4. flows in the subarachnoid space between the meningial layers
5. reabsorbed from the subarachoid space into the venous blood across the subarachnoid villi

**hydrocephalus** occurs when there is too much CSF (pressure is too high), which can result in brain damage. 

##### BBB

- consists of endothelial cells with tight junctions, forcing materials from the blood to pass through the cells of the capillaries
- transport of anything that is not a small water soluble substance or a lipid soluble substance occurs through highly selective membrane-bound carries
- Astrocytes surround areas with a BBB and attach to the cappilaries with their podocytes. 
	- they signal cells forming the capillaries to make tight junctions 
	- participate in the cross cellular transport of some substances like K+

**circumventricular organs** are areas of the brain where blood is sampled for homostatic purposes, and thus there is no BBB. 

##### Oxegen and Glucose in the brain

- the brain can only perform aerobic respiration
- **neuroglobin** is the oxegen carring molecule in the brain tissue
- the brain only uses **glucose** as a fuel source


### 3.4 Spinal Cord (100-)

##### Vertebral Canal

- spinal cord travels down vertbral canal
- 31 pairs of spinal nerves emerge from the spinal cord through the arches of adjacent vertebrae
- 8 cervial (neck) nerves
- 12 thoracic (chest) nerves
- 5 lumbar (abdominal) nerves
- 5 sarcal (pelvic) nerves
- 1 coccygeal (tailbone) nerve
- most spinal nerves must travel for some distance down the vertebral column before emerging (the vertegral column is longer than the spinal cord)
- The **cauda equina** is the thick bundle of nerves within the lower vertebral canal
- **spinal taps** obtain a sample of the CSF below the level of the second lumbar vertebrae to prevent any rist of penetrating the spinal cord 

##### Grey and White Matter

- **white matter** surround the grey matter in the spinal cord
	- white matter is organized into tracts which myelinated axons of long interneurons with a similar function. 
	- **Ascending tracts** transmit information to the brain, while **descending tracts** transmit information from the brain to the body
- **grey matter** consists of efferent cell bodies, their dendries, short interneurons, glial cells, and afferent synaptic terminals 
	- **dorsal horn** houses synpatic terminals of afferent neurons. Houses interneuron cell bodies. 
	- ** lateral horn** is home to interneuron axons. Also has cell bodies of autonomic efferent neurons. 
	- **ventral horn** houses motor neuron efferent neuron cell bodies.

##### Spinal Nerves

- connect with the spinal cord via a dorsal root and ventral root
- **dorsal root**: afferent
- **ventral root**: efferent
- **dorsal root ganglion** houses the cell bodies of afferent neurons. 
- dorsal and ventral roots join to form a spinal nerve 
- a **nerve** is a bundle of peripheral neuronal axons enclosed by a covering of connective tissue. There are no nerves in the CNS.
- Bundles of axons in the CNS are called tracts
- 31 spinal and 12 cranial nerves consitute the peripheral nervous system

A **dermatome** is an area of the body surface supplied by a particular spinal nerve. 


##### Basic Reflexes

A **reflex** is a response that occurs without concious effort. 

- **simple (basic) reflexes** are built in
- **aquired (conditioned) reflexes** are learned

##### Reflex Arc

1. Receptor
2. Afferent Pathway
3. Integrator
4. Efferent Pathway
5. Effector

##### Stretch Reflex

- **monosynaptic (vs polysynaptic):** afferent neuron synapses directly to efferent neuron
- originates in stretch receptor of muscle
- allows for optimal resting length to be maintained
- eg. patellar tendon reflex
