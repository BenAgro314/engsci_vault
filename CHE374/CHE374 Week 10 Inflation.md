# Inflation

**Inflation:** a rise in the average prices of goods and services over time. This reflecst a decline in purchasing power of the dollar over time. 

**Deflation:** is the opposite.

##### Causes of Inflation
- **demand pull:** more money (or low taxes and low interest rates -> more borrowing -> higher demand -> pushes up prices
- **cost push:** higher costs to create goods and services -> increased prices
- **expanding money supply:** decreases the value of the money (prices can't stay the same if there is more money out there). Can happen if we print more money or banks loan out money
- **expectations:** people expect their salaries and prices to go up by a small percent every year. Creates a feedback loop.

##### Effects of Inflation
- **benefits borrowers:** get to pay back money that is worth less after time
- **hurts lenders**
- **hurts people who earned money in the past (savers, unemployed, retirees)**
- **Menu costs and tax distortions**: must reprint menu's and other logistical issues. Tax brackets must change over time. 
- **Short run:**
	- higher inflation leads to lower unemployment (in the short run)
		- buisness try to higher more people to sell goods at that higher price
- at low levels, **inflation can stimulate the economy** (incentivises buy money right now as opposed to later)
- **hyperinflation:** inflation that is too high
	- this can be devestating for an economy
		- a vicious cycle: people expect prices to go up so they cash their paychecks imediately and drive up demand.

##### Target Inflation Rate
- bank of canada's **primary mission** is to **keep inflation at about 2%**

##### Why do we not just have an inflation rate of 0%?
- inflation is bad, but deflation is often worse.
- low levels of inflation are fine, deflation is bad
	- prices drop -> don't buy things right away (wait) -> stores lower prices -> more deflation (vicious cycle)

##### How is inflation measured
- consumer price index (CPI)
	- measures the weighted average of prices of a basket of goods and services which are of primary consumer need
	- CPI is the average rate of price change for the items in the basket of goods
	- CPI includes: transportation, recreation, medical care, education and communication, food and beverages, other goods and services, housing, apparel
	- CPI for a given period relates the average price of a fixed basket of goods in the given period to the average price of the same basket of goods in a base period
	- current CPI base period is 2002
	- base year index is set at 100 
	- index for any other year indicates the number of dollars needed in that year to buy the basket of goods that cost $100 in 2002. 
- Use CPI to find inflation rate between two given years. Convert rate to yearly if we want to find the average yearly inflation rate over a certain period of time. 

##### Calculations With Inflation

**Actual dollars (current or nominal dollars):** expressed in the monetary units at the time the cash flows occur

**Real (constant) dollars:** expressed in the monetary units of constant purchasing power, and must always be associated with a particular date

**Symbols**
$$r_{actual}$$ or $$i_A$$ or $$i$$: actual interest rate. Observed interest rate based on actual dollars.
$$f$$: inflation rate
$$r_{real}$$ or $$i_R$$ or $$i'$$: real interest rate. interest rate based on dollars of constant purchasing power. 
For discrete compounding periods:
$$ 1+ r_{real} = \frac{1 + r_{actual}}{1 + f}$$
For continuous compounding:
$$ r_{real} = r_{actual} - f$$

##### Economic Valuation With Inflation

- actual values
	- adjust for inflation
	- use actual MARR

- real values
	- do not adjust for inflation 
	- use real MARR

- notes:
	- most market rates are based on actual rates 
	- sometimes risk free rate can drop below inflation rate because we can only estimate current inflation rates 
	- in times of uncertainty, investors may keep their money in risk free investments
	
##### Inflation with tax benefits	

- in accounting we use actual values 
- must use actual rates in tax benefit factors
- you must use the actual rates in the tax benefit factors, but can use use real or actual values for salvage as long as it is discounted with the appropriate rate
- give growth rate $$g$$ is based on actual dollars: use actual marr and change value of first benifit based on inflation
